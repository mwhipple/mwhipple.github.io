    <p>
      The script here effectively wraps up the documentation for
      <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent"
	 title="Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account - GitHub Docs"
	 data-time="2024-05-21">generating SSH keys for GithHub</a>.
      At the moment this is entirely untested and therefore likely has
      a lot of wrinkles which will be smoothed out (it was created on
      a system that doesn't need it for the sake of other systems).
    </p>

    <pre>
#!/bin/bash
declare -r email="${1?Provide email address as first argument}"
declare -r output_file="${2?Provide key file as second argument}"
declare -r title="${3?Provide title as third argument}"

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "${email}" -f "${output_file}"
gh ssh-key add "${output_file}.pub" --type authentication --title "${title}"
    </pre>

    <p>
      Note aboute auth...

      Example in ~/.ssh/config
    </p>
    <pre>
      Host github.com-mw
        Hostname github.com
        User git
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_mw
    </pre>
    <p>
      Reboot ssh-agent
