- [Up to Home](./)

Home ownership seems to largely consist of triaging the
effects of endless entropy, and maybe occasionally squeezing
in some time and/or money for improvements.

This in particular is an activity that I do sporadically and
so will capture information to both try to establish more of
a framework and also to keep tabs on things over time.

## Toilet Runs Frequently (Handle Jiggling)

Toilets seem to need some fairly frequent attention based
on my limited experience.

The toilet in my downstairs bathroom will regularly run and
needs its handle jiggled. I think at some point the chain
got disconnected and I may not have reconnected it properly
(or things just stretched a bit). In any case the running
is caused by the flapper getting tangled in the chain and
so the length of the chain likely needs to be adjusted.

I'd originally thought that the connection would allow for
adjusting the number of links, but I must have been thinking
of some connection somewhere else (maybe another toilet).
The chain is connected by a hook where the length of the
chain does not appear to be readily adjustable...and while
it almost certainly is in one way or another I'll defer
going that route. To start there are two eyes on the arm
into which the hook could be placed and I've switched the hook
from the one that is further from the lever to the inner one.

It still occasionally runs - one quirk with this toilet is that
the valve for the pipe is _right_ up against the toilet itself
so it has to be pushed to be turned. I don't think the water
itself was turned on all the way which could presumably inhibit
sealing so I opened that. The flapper also has multiple places
at which the chain could be attached so that will be my next
variable to explore.

Not surprisingly, turning up the water didn't help (that would be
a very fragile solution). I removed the flapper and reattached
the chain to the outermost option (where it was on the innermost),
and reattached the other end to the outer eye of the handle lever.
