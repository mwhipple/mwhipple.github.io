I noticed not too long ago that my right ear seems a bit clogged compared
to my left (as does my right nostril which is potentially related). This
became particularly prominent at one point during the pandemic and has recently
started to resurface in the mornings during the winter - presumably due to
the lower humidity of heated air. I'm currently trying to track down a doctor
and look for professional advice/cleaning but while waiting for that I'll also
be looking to improve it myself.

More significantly I recently went on a family vacation at an indoor water park and
now that ear is remaining clogged. It is not in any pain, but it is impacting my
hearing a bit which in addition to being a nuisance is disturbing my ability to hear
myself when playing music.

I've been trying a few things while trying to steer clear of those that may do
damage.
