My personal perspective in automotive technology is dominated
by sustainability and minimalism, but I also have some professional
interest and therefore will dig a bit more deeply.

## Autonomous Vehicles

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) (specifically land vehicles) are something for which
I'm very hopeful since they could reduce or avoid the need for ownership
and similarly could reduce the number of total vehicles needed to exist
given that the capacity could be defined in terms of the amount of
contemporaneous volume of travel rather than what translates to what
is closer to a capacity that effectively represents everyone traveling
simultaneously (where this feels like a generally recurring fallacy
that likely has a name). This also lends itsely to further optimizations
in terms of both reducing travel time (i.e. reducing traffic) and
introducing queuing with corresponding incentives to reduce needed capacity
by absorbing bursts (similar to existing peak/congestion pricing models
where a given traveler pays extra or waits some amount of time).
Unfortunately In addition to many of the immediate
[practical challenges](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3654812 "ACM TechBrief: Automated Vehicles, ACM Technology Policy Council (Issue 10, Winter 2024)"){atime="2024-09-15"},
I'm also somewhat skeptical in the realization of such
reductions in that it may challenge the business models of many involved
players (i.e. manufacturers) and the persistent risk that such gains
in efficiency are offset by rebound effects.

At present there remains a fairly wide gap between the current state
of artifical initelligence (AI) systems and their envisioned end state and
their advertised abilities (which should be covered elsewhere) and AVs are a particularly
clear example of this given the surrounding safety concerns.
AVs may operate in environments with a virtually unlimited number of
variables which can fall very easily into the cracks of modern AI.
In particularly chaotic environments such as India,
[stocastism may be embraced](https://spectrum.ieee.org/india-self-driving-car "Startups Say India Is Ideal for Testing Self-Driving Cars - IEEE Spectrum"){atime="2024-07-01},
but the more typical approach by US companies seems to be seeking to
cover the fantastically long tail.
Operating in environments where such variables can be controlled is
a wise and employed tactic,
though it is important in other cases to make sure
that variations are not aggregated away when presenting statistics and that
instead significant conditional probabilies are expressed. This can help
paint an appropriately
[nuanced picture](https://spectrum.ieee.org/autonomous-vehicles-great-at-straights "Autonomous Vehicles Are Great at Driving Straight - IEEE Spectrum"){atime="2024-06-29}
which may also feed more directly into questions around how the levels of
autonomy within the system could safely integrate with propsective human
intervevention when necessary (where this may also be more
[common than perceived](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/03/technology/zoox-self-driving-cars-remote-control.html "See How Humans Help Self-Driving Cars Navigate City Streets - The New York Times"){atime="2024-09-13"}
). This translates to not not only
prospective deficiencies within the systems but risks around
[dangerous fallback behaviors](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/automakers-ask-us-agency-reconsider-emergency-braking-rule-2024-06-24/ "Automakers ask US agency to reconsider emergency braking rule | Reuters"){atime="2024-06-24}.

Beyond the AI concerns, there will also be ongoing work in compensating
for prospective failures or deficiencies with
[sensors](https://spectrum.ieee.org/autonomous-vehicles "Self-Driving Cars Get Better at Driving in the Dark - IEEE Spectrum"){atime="2024-09-12"},
so this is a particularly hairy problem from multiple angles.

## Landscape

Electric vehicles are a place where China is poised to claim a fairly
dominant position. In addition to attempting to produce competitive
products, economic strategies such as
[tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/business/eu-china-ev-tariffs.html "E.U. Hits Electric Vehicles From China With Higher Tariffs - The New York Times"){atime="2024-06-12"}
along with more cut-and-dried
[bans](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biden-proposes-banning-chinese-vehicles-us-roads-with-software-crackdown-2024-09-23/ "Biden proposes banning Chinese vehicles, 'connected car' technology from US roads | Reuters"){atime="2024-10-21"}
may also be applied to at least relieve some pressue for
domestic copmanies.

## V2X (Vehicle to Everything)

Vehicles connecting to a range of infrastructure and other devices is
gaining traction (maybe pun?). There have been some initial projects 
involving 
[smart highways](https://www.axios.com/2024/07/02/smart-highway-i-94-michigan "Smart highway pilot construction completed in Michigan"){atime="2024-07-02"}
and

along with recommendations from the department of transportation.
