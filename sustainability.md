- [Up to About Me](about_me)

I strive to adopt sustainable practices, which for me largely amounts
to reduction and simplification. There seems to be an unfortunate tension
between sustainability and consumerism which leads to implication that
sustainability should be layered on top of existing consumption and
messages around reduction being buried or spun. This can translate into not
only a house of cards in the service of seeking to enable existing patterns
but worse scenarios such as encouraging replacement of existing products
with those that may be more efficient products without a path to amortize
production impacts (not to say there aren't cases where such amortization is evident).
I tend to pursue such goals
through tuning of my actions rather than anything more comprehensively aggressive.

I try to consume from companies that support this goal, both those that are local
and aligned with many of the values. As a disclaimer most such assessments are done
based on last mile assessments - there are certainly plenty of places where such
assessments may not be accurate but I don't have the expertise or capacity to
perform more complete analysis of concerns like supply chains and adjust my
purchasing accordingly. I do incorporate any such information I find out and
expect such evident value alignment to translate up the chain at least insofar
as misalignments are more likely to bubble up (i.e. it is far more likely that
interesting information would be revealed if it is inconsistent with a vendor's
image).

One particular value I'm pursuing currently is plastic neutrality. While fields
as medicine can likely benefit from plastics they are ubiquiotus and raise
concerns both in the form of non-renewable materials for manufacturing
(specific petroleum) and in degrading to
[microplastics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics "Microplastics - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-02-19"}.

While the prospect of recycling may be helpful, most statistics suggest that it
may only help with the tip of the iceberg. It also unfortunately aligns supply chains
with plastic materials which could incentivize additional plastic production, and
even the attribution of something as being made from recycled materials may be
[less that straightforward](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/26/business/energy-environment/tritan-renew-plastic-bottles-recycled.html "Why Plastic Water Bottles May Not Contain as Much Recycled Plastic as Advertised - The New York Times"){atime="2024-09-01"}.
This reflects the larger sentiment that recycling is good practice, but only as the
last resort after reduction and reuse (where in this case that could be focused
on plastics and less renewable resources specifically).

Sustainability also helps inform my career path, and I seek to incorporate some
practices into
