    <h1>HTTP</h1>

    <p>
      I've spent a fair amount of time dealing with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP"
	 title="HTTP - Wikipedia"
	 data-atime="2024-04-23">HTTP</a>, and am
      currently digging into it a bit again particularly given that most of
      my in-depth hands-on experience with the details was
      during the period when HTTP/2 was displacing SPDY and therefore
	 I was fairly eagerly awaiting some of HTTP/2's features but
	 did not have the opportunity to acquire much practical
	 experience. As I'm again in a position where such knowledge
	 can yield substantive benefits, I need to brush up on HTTP/2
	 and HTTP/3.
