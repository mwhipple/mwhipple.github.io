      is a provisional name I'm giving to my overall approach to
      organizing information, based on the idea by Vannevar Bush
      as published in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think"
	 title"As We May Think - Wikipedia"
	 data-atime="2024-03-30">As We May Think</a>
      which has been similarly borrowed many times. The term may be
      swapped if it is determined it is not particularly suitable or
      invites too much confusion, I've alternatively called it my
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimoire"
	 title="Grimoire - Wikipedia"
	 data-atime="2024-03-29">grimoire</a>
      (to swap from one nerdy idea to another).

      The underlying pursuit is that of collecting and composing concepts,
      which is certainly not a novel nor innovative pursuit. This has been
      an effort that has passed through several incarnations over the
      years but is potentially somewhat sharpened by the recent emergence
      of viable generative AI. This amounts to the pursuit of a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data"
	 title="Linked data - Wikipedia"
	 data-atime="2024-03-29">linked data</a>
      style network of trustworthy
      (i.e. falsifiable/empirical/authoritative) information alongside
      constructions of such information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again, this is not anything new but the overall effort seems to
      consistently run up against biases that push things away from those
      goals except in fields in which they are enforced. Practical
      information tends to fall into silos as pieces of it are carved off
      and contorted into new contexts after which it is more subject to
      reproduction and dilution through cargo culting, and likely due to
      a human bias towards certainty concepts tend to get subsumed by
      specifics, leading to unnecessarily repeated attention on questions
      of how rather than what (certainly worth asking...but often not
      repeating).

      This is also pretty emphatically aspirational, this has not yet led
      anywhere for me and there's not much of a reason to think that it
      will.

      In terms of "concepts" this is focused on seeking solutions which
      are portable and mostly declarative, without getting tangled up with
      underlying engines. That specific term was adopted after having attended
      a talk by
      <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/daniel-jackson-on-the-essence-of-software"
	 title="Daniel Jackson on The Essence of Software | Princeton University Press"
	 data-atime="2024-03-30">Daniel Jackson</a>.
      I've not yet read his book
      but based on the talk his use of concept seemed to distill several overlapping
      ideas into a framework that cuts across software, cognition, and reality.

      This is also driven by an underlying goal of
      insulating abstract models from particular representations. This
      seems very much in line with the foundations of software engineering
      in that it rests on top of many layers of abstraction where perhaps
      the most prominent boundary is that software is written without
      knowledge of the circuits that underlie most modern computers
      which has allowed the field to progress from earlier types of
      machines (such as from vacuum to solid state)
      and to expand to other variations such as quantum and
      biological. This is not to dismiss those cases where higher levels of
      <a href="https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.mechanical-sympathy.en.html"
	 title="Mechanical Sympathy - AWS Well-Architected Framework"
	 data-atime="2024-03-29">mechanical sympathy</a>
      are valuable, but to posit that there is more
      value in abstraction. Unfortunately
      software in practice tends to also lean in the opposite direction
      where too much focus on details of representation of logic and data
      introduces levels of Balkanization and corresponding
      inefficiency. To some extent this is the nature of the beast as
      programming is largely the practice of realizing abstractions in
      precise, computable forms which naturally requires selection of such
      forms, but preserving the notion that all such forms are incidental
      can ensure that they are treated as such and attention remains more
      properly focused on the essence.
