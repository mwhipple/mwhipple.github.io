- [Up to Scouts](scouts)

Attaching badges to uniforms is something that is definitely
outside of my wheelhouse, and while there's apparently the option
of having it done at the scout shop, I'll attempt at least to do
it myself.

My wife originally took on that responsibility and used Badge Magic,
but as my daughter joined and my son has grown I'm looking to do a
shirt swap which involves moving the badges around.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4MalEJXpHk "Removing Badge Magic - YouTube"){atime=2024-08-17}
from Badge Magic provides guidance. Though they seem to recommend
Goo Gone over Goof Off, the video itself uses Goof Off and getting
the right formula of the former seemed less obvious, so I picked up
some Good Off and the badges easily came off.
