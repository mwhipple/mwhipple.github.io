    <p>
      I tend to leave my laptop silent and so sound is something I
      neglect until I need it, and while I usually have a baseline set
      up where the kernel and ALSA is configured properly I lose track
      of what additional services/daemons sit above that which may be
      used by software (such as Firefox).
