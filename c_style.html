One of the most pressing concerns when writing C is around error handling.
Not only does the language not provide much in the way of dealing with errors
and many of the older standard mechanism not play well with mutli-threading
and reentrance, but since the language itself is somewhat hosted with minimal
assumptions about its runtime there are many more possible errors that written
code needs to account for that may otherwise be absorbed by a runtime
(for example when dealing with dynamic memory).

In order to rein in the range of such errors

In Fluent C this is named the "Samurai Principle" but per

it may not be entirely appropriate depending on how it is applied.
