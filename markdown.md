- [Up to Content](content)

Markdown is a simple language with multiple flavors that introduce
different functionality.

When available (including for this site) my preferred style
is that provided by
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown "Pandoc's Markdown"){atime=2024-07-17}

After having gone back and forth, I prefer ATX style headings given that they provide
a consistent pattern through all supported levels.
