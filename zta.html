      <h1>Zero Trust Architecture</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Zero Trust Architecture is what the cool kids are doing now as it
    becomes increasingly crucial as systems and the ways in which we interact
    with them become less centralized.</p>

    <p>Though I'll use it herein since it seems to be the predominant phrasing,
    I'm personally not a fan of the "Zero Trust" terminology as it is overly
    extreme which anecdotally can lend itself to abuse (I've seen some
    convoluted and insecure designs implemented in the name of Zero Trust). A
    fundamental underpinning of security is establishing and managing trust and
    in that light the moniker can lead to simplistic and/or neglectful
    perspectives. Zero Trust eschews more implicit trust mechanisms,
    particularly those stemming from (network) location or zone; presumably if "trust"
    were designated to only refer to such incidental attributes rather than
    those designed for more secure authentication the term is accurate, but
    that deviates from common use and therefore does not seem conducive to
    understanding. Per Rais, et al.. "Zero Trust" is granted to the "network" which
    matches that narrow and confusion breeding designation (particularly given the
    possible interpretations of what constitutes a network although the implied
    meaning is clear within the full context).
    Alternatives such as "deperimeterization" seem to be both
    clearer and less prone to hype and misuse.</p>

    <p>Deperimeterization is clearer in that it clearly positions itself as
    opposed to many previous practices which amounted to expecting security
    to be enforced at a perimeter, but similar to the trust argument perimeters
    or boundaries continue to exist and their impact on the larger security
    picture should be understood rather than seeking their annihilation.
    Ultimately the approach can be distilled to the notion that each severable
    component should be secured independently rather than expecting transitive
    security.</p>

    <p>Phil Vachon provides a nice metaphorical overview of the breaking down
    of security perimeters in pragmatic terms in <a href=

    <p>Unfortunately there's seemingly a dearth of actionable security standards
    in general. The NIST is coordinating such an effort for
