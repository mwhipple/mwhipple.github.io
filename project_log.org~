#+TITLE: Project Log

In this area I'll capture notes for projects I've worked on...many of
these may have useful information but many of them also are likely to
go nowhere, but they're still likely useful for me since I'm likely to
keep vague memories I've things I've encountered but forget the
details.

These are likely to also initially be very rough and may or may not be
cleaned up over time.
