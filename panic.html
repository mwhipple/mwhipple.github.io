Panic is the term (borrowed from Go's usage among others)
I use to refer to errors which are never expected at runtime and
therefore should not expect to be handled and should result in some form of termination
on the error.
</p><p>
Making this distinction is useful regardless of the error handling approaches used.
In languages that return error status or Either values a panic need not be accounted
for in the signature. In languages that provide exception style constructs such
exceptions should not be caught. In all such cases they can aid in keeping both
the primary and error handling code focused.
</p><p>
This concept should be reserved for cases where such behavior should never
happen and therefore be even more constrained than reserving exceptions for
exceptional behavior. When related to business logic their presence may also
suggest a design smell and opporunities to modify the design such that there
is no path to what is considered impossible should be explored, leveraging
additional mechanisms such as type systems where feasible (and that guidance
also extends to other possible error causes such as data inconsistency which
should absolutely not be considered a panic).
</p><p>
Anecdotally one of the times I hijacked this concept for wide use was in
wrapping an internal client library where many of the API endpoints called
produced results from which we had to make assumptions (such as asserting
that a collection was a singleton). For me this is a clear example of a design
smell in that the API operations and corresponding client should have been
expressive enough to avoid the need for such assertions, but pragmatically
it was useful as the organization was one in which change was difficult and
slow and as APIs also tend to have _many_ possible errors it was useful
to delineate those that cannot be handled as prerequisite logic is
seemingly broken.
</p><p>
Panics remain useful however, such as when the runtime itself is considered
compromised and therefore should be aborted, or when limitations in language
used or general computability leave logic that should never be executed
(for example if arms exist to fully cover a case match but such coverage
is not detectable by the compiler).
