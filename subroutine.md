title: Subroutine
---

- [Up to Software](software)

Subroutine is the provisional term I'll use for a chunk of
reused logic in programming. In most languages this will
consist of some kind of name and signature involving
	  parameters and return value or values, along with a body which
	  contains the implementation, though this term is also seems
	  general enough to cover reuse without that type of interface
	  (such as in assembly or Forth).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Potentially the most common name for such a construct is
	  "function", though I'm reluctant to use that too generally
	  due to the utility of the mathematical definition which
	  doesn't apply to "impure functions".
	</p>
	<p>
	  In object-oriented languages the term "method" may be used
	  which is appropriate when working with an instance but gets
	  stretched a bit when there's a desire to define functions that
	  then masquerade as "static methods" even if they don't
	  interact with their surrounding namespace (i.e. operating on
	  class-wide data)...but more of warts with overuse of
	  object-oriented programming will be covered separately.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Finally potentially on the opposite end of "function" would be
	  "procedure" which is not particularly in fashion but at least
	  seems to imply action/side effects which may not always be
	  appropriate.
