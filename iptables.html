            data-atime="2024-06-29">iptables</a> is a utility
        which I was fairly familiar with around the time it was
        displacing ipchains but have tended to deal with it
        rarely since that time. It is now apparently also deprecated
        in favor of nftables, but end-of-life'ing will likely take a bit
        of time.</p>
      <p>Given that I don't deal with firewall related concerns directly
      too often (though I do have some related projects in the wings),
      iptables is primarily relevant to me within the context of containerized
      execution environments and routing across the resulting network namespaces,
      and a larger scale handling some intra-cluster routing within environments
      such as kubernetes.</p>
