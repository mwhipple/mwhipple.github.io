 This site is deployed to
 <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run"
    title="Cloud Run | Google Cloud"
    data-date="2024-01-20">Google Cloud Run</a>
 using an
 <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx"
    title="nginx - Official Image | Docker Hub"
    data-date="2024-01-22">nginx docker image</a>
 with overlaid content and configuration.
 </p><p>
 Cloud Run was adopted since it is a technology I use for some
 professional projects and was therefore able to reuse some experience.
 </p><p>
 Additionally
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx"
    title="Nginx - Wikipedia"
    data-date="2024-01-29">nginx</a>
 is a technology which fits in to some of my other goals,
 and while alternatives such as publishing static files only may seem simpler
 they are also less transparent and more limiting in terms of some basic
 functionality such as
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_negotiation"
    title="Content negotiation - Wikipedia"
    data-date="2024-01-22">content negotiation</a>
 which can facilitate logical URLs which are more easily kept
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI"

 <p>
 The build requires
 <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/"
    title="Use the Docker command line | Docker Docs"
    data-date="2024-01-30">docker CLI</a>
 (or compatible) to produce the images, and the
 <a href="https://cloud.google.com/cli
    title="Command Line Interface Gcloud Cli | Google Cloud"
    data-date="2024-01-25">gcloud CLI</a>
 to autenticate with the artifact registry and trigger updates.
 </p><p>
 Those dependencies are defined here for possible overriding
 or extensibility such as more sophisticated feedback.

 <pre>

DOCKER      := docker
GCLOUD      := gcloud

 </pre>
 <p>Generated files will be placed in a conventional
 "build" directory to keep things tidier and cleanup more simple.</p>
 <pre>

BUILD_DIR := build
$(BUILD_DIR): ; mkdir -p $(@)

 </pre>
 <p>The tag for the image will be generated based on the current git
 ref. As a side effect changes should be committed prior to
 building.
 </p><p>
 A pattern I often use elsewhere is to add an additional qualifier
 to the tag if the working directory contains any uncommitted changes
 which guards against inadvertently pushing an image
 which has local changes that deviate from what is reflected in the
 repository (and therefore having a misleading tag). Given the
 sole authorship of the content and the nature of the project itself
 (i.e. that it is primarily content rather than logic), I am
 dispensing with that additional logic for the time being.
