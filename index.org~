Welcome to the latest iteration of my Web site.

I'll be copying information from previous incarnations.

** Google App Engine

[[#src-gae][Google App Engine]] is a viable hosting option that came up fairly
early in my information navigation and seems to potentially fit the
right set of criteria. Google Cloud is also a technology I'll be using
for work and one which I haven't spent too much time (like much of the
industry I'm far more comfortable with AWS).

I used and evangelized GAE a fair amount quite a while ago (prior to
and during the period when it went General Availability), and would be
likely to use it again if I were looking to develop an appropriate
app. While I'm currently looking to use the flexible model for
containerized deployment I've generally been of the mindset that
adapting designs to fit within the constraints of systems like GAE can
provide significant upfront benefits. Typically the aversion to such
technologies that I've seen seems to be a fixed mindset where people
are turned off that they can't use their preferred hammers, which
isn't to say that that isn't often a compelling reason, particularly
for an organization. Similarly there may be some cases for which a
particular type of technology is most appropriate but an awkward
fit. Additionally I haven't run the numbers for GAE in particular but
in most similar systems there's a breakeven point after which it is
likely to be far more cost effective to use something closer to the
metal even after accounting for the operational overhead. But...as
mentioned the _upfront_ benefits can be substantial and other than
cultural resistance (which isn't a concern for my personal projects)
many of the other concerns are initially aspirational.

For this particular project I'll be looking to make use of the
[[file:sources.org::#gae-flexible][flexible environment]] as I'm very comfortable with dealing with
containers and I'll be starting to use a non-supported runtime and
likely evolving into making use of a relatively standard container
which is also not directly supported, so in both cases relying on a
[[#src-gae-custom][custom runtime]]. An enticing longer term plan may be to switch to [[#src-gae-cloud-run][Cloud
Run]] as it is likely to be lower cost at low volume, but in the
immediate term it seems like a distraction and I may also want to look
at more static-centric alternatives in the future.
