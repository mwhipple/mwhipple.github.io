I just finished Jonathan Franzen's
[The Corrections](https://www.amazon.com/Corrections-Novel-Jonathan-Franzen/dp/0312421273 "The Corrections: A Novel: Franzen, Jonathan: 9780312421274: Amazon.com: Books"){atime=2024-08-04}
as I've resolved to read more frequently and more broadly
and that book appeared on a recent NYT list of the best books of
the century thus far and it was already in my house.

The book was a very nice dose of perspective, and that it was written at a time
that still seems so modern but since which so much has changed (at least
superficially) was very interesting.

I drew some inspiration from the book for a song I'm working through about
identity.

The book was well-written, though I would say that the author's sensibilities
seemed to encroach a bit on some of the characters's internal monologues such
that they leaned a bit towards a literary and self-aware homogeneity,
but that was ultimately a fairly minor and potentially imagined undertone
(and the characters were still engaging).
