title: Technical Debt
---

- [Up to Software](software)

Technical Debt is unfortunately a terribly abused metaphor.
Somewhat ironically it was coined to use business/accounting concepts
to make technical considerations more accessible but it is those
concepts that seem to be either ignored or misunderstood such that
Technical Debt is often treated as "anything technical that we wish
didn't exist" rather than things which should be able to be treated
as _debt_.

Years ago I had a more lax perspective and bought into the quadrant
model mentioned by Fowler, but I then witnessed a culture where that
led to mismanagement of such debt; without differentiating accrual of
debt from any undesirable expenses it can be easy to stumble your
way into insolvency which in technical terms can translate to thoughts
such as "it doesn't matter if we cut all of these corners for this
new system since we'll just add that to the backlog along with
sunsetting our legacy systems".

There's also a somewhat related concept of
[civilization debt](https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/11/good-companies-civilization-debt/ "How Good Companies Can Leverage Agile to Fight Civilizational Debt - InfoQ"){atime="2024-09-01"}.
While this certainly has different underlying motivations, those motivations
appeal to me and I'd also aver (without particular support) that many of
the debt management strategies would overlap.
