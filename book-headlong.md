I recently read
[Headlong](https://www.amazon.com/Headlong-Ron-MacLean/dp/1938692985 "Headlong"){atime="2024-05-21"}
by Ron MacLean. I worked with Ron at the time it was published and
grabbed a copy at a reading he did in Somerville at the time, but given
my shabby history of reading for pleasure I only got around to reading
it ten years later.

The delay was probably overall fortunate in that I'm now at the same
stage of life as the protagonist. It's a good book; there are aspects
that may be dated given how much has changed in the world since then and
how much the book draws on the passed present (but I'm far too
cloistered to be an accurate gauge of that), but the underlying themes
and messages are timeless and the book delivered a compelling blend of
entertainment sprinkled with emotional tugs.

It was rather different from the presumptions I'd imposed upon it and
deepens my perspective on a former colleague (with whom I haven\'t
retained contact).
