title: Strict Mode
---

- [Up to Software](software)

"Strict mode" is used to refer to settings and pragmas which make some
languages and systems more normal and less forgiving. Often such systems
can be used for quick, one-off'ish, scripting needs in which case more
leniency may be helpful but in cases where more substantial logic is
being created it is desirable to configure the system to guard against
misfiring black magic and DWIMmery.

## JavaScript

`"use strict";` as a statement enforces compliance with newer ECMAScript standards.
