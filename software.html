        <h2>Software Selection</h2>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most fundamental task in dealing with computer software is deciding
          which software to use. Often momentum narrows the field but in other
          cases there may be a wide range of options without evident reasons to
          favor some over others.
        </p><p>
          One helpful means to discover projects that are likely to have active community
          engagement and wide support is to look at projects which have been accepted by
          larger initiatives. For example graduated projects from the
          <a href="https://www.cncf.io/"
             title="Cloud Native Computing Foundation"
             data-atime="2024-06-04">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a>
          are likely to be strong contenders when working in (unsurpisingly) cloud native
          environments.

              title="Million Dollar Lines of Code - an Engineering Perspective on Cloud Cost Optimization - InfoQ"
              data-time="2024-06-17">Million Dollar Lines of Code</a> provides some decent war stories around
              lack of cost management and lands on the useful formula of tracking what cost efficiency rather than
              blindly seeking cost reduction. It seems somewhat appropriate as an introduction to the concerns but
              seems to leave some gaps as it focuses on fairly discrete examples and then jumps to a metric
              without providing strong guidance around more consistent principles and monitoring (there's a
              related concept I need to extract that draws on things like Murphy's Law, Safety II, and Release It!).
              The latter also seems notable in that the <a href="premature_optimization">"premature optimization..."</a>
              quote is mentioned (attributed to Hoare) but without an actionable less "evil" alternative.</p>
