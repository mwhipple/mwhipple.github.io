-   [Up to Content](content)

Lists contain a sequence of elements presented as a certain type.
Depending on the format used the elements may implicitly define list
properties, or the list may be defined as a container in which the
elements inherit relevant properties from the list itself.

List Elements

[HTML](html)

In HTML list elements are defined by the list item [li
element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-li-element%20The%20li%20element)

Markdown

In Markdown list elements imply the list themselves and are therefore
documented in the respective types of lists.
