[Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs "Emacs - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-04-30"}
is a tool I keep crawling back to.
For the time being I'll be using it as my primary baseline for interactions,
but that may be revisited if other pieces start to snap
together. In particular I'm currently using the emacs-ng fork.
