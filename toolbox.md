## Editors

I spend the vast majority of my time working in editors. These are predominantly
text editors...though often "text" often is relevant due to some combination of
accient and POSIX baggage which is something I'll aspirationally start to relax
but that's unlikely to be more than ideological in the mid-term.

### nano 

[Nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano "GNU nano - Wikipedia"){data-atime="2024-07-11"} is
currently my default text editor. I'm drawn to it in that it is focused and readily
configured to operate within a Software Tools model where fairly sophisticated behavior
could be defined in the form of calls to external command flows. The
[source code](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/nano.git/log/ "nano.git - GNU nano") is
very clean and readable, and I'm also likely to ultimately create my own toy version
of it to make it a bit more extensible, support personal conventions, and just to
play around with technologies.

### emacs

[Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs "Emacs - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-04-30"}
is a tool I keep crawling back to.
For the time being I'll be using it as my primary baseline for interactions,
but that may be revisited if other pieces start to snap
together. In particular I'm currently using the emacs-ng fork.
