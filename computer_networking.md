Radia Perlman has nice [interview](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/internet-protocols-myths/ "Computer Networks: Myths, Missteps, and Mysteries - InfoQ"){atime="2024-09-07"}
where she goes into some of the relationship between Ethernet other networking
protocols and how we've ended up in the current state. She also
 provides advice around avoiding over-complication which seems typical
of things I've heard from her. I found some of the information enlightening;
I definitely do not need to regularly care about things like mapping protocols to
networking stack layers, but this clarified some confusion that would tickle
somewhere in the back of my mind when trying to reconcile IP being layer 3
and Ethernet being...somewhere. I also found the position on "addresses"
interesting since some of the current behaviors have become normalized to me
over time without assessing the relationship between addresses and routing.
