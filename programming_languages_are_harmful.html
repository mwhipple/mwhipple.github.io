<h2 id="orgfcb0772"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Backstory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Over my career I've programmed in a range of different languages and
I'm currently nursing an idea that languages offer tenuous return on
investment to the software industry. Don't get me wrong, I certainly
think many languages have contributed many great ideas and I'm also
vehemently opposed to panaceas and golden hammers and therefore
recognize that some problems are best explored using appropriate means
of expression.
</p>

<p>
The back-breaking straw of this idea was likely spending a chunk of
one of my days spelunking through Python's SSL implementation and
corresponding C code to work through a bug whose behavior I could
readily reproduce and resolve using the <code>openssl</code> command. While I
used this as a chance to brush up on some TLS details the main
lingering impression was the large tracts of code that existed not to
do anything new, but simply to re-express an established solution (the
particular issue was resolved by swapping out <code>LibreSSL</code> for <code>OpenSSL</code>).
Some other recent background context was likely being engaged in
several conversations around language adoption, and somewhat
relatively recently within an engineering culture that had a "one
language to rule them all" mindset even when the output of that
mindset was often bizarre paths of using that language to invoke shell
commands to launch other languages or containers (which I looked to
simplify as things broke&#x2026;which they often did).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
A well-known exchange in the annals of computing history is Doug
McIlroy's criticism of a program Don Knuth wrote to demonstrate
literate programming for Jon Bentley's Programming Pearls CACM column
(with the underlying premise that if software is treated as literature
it should be subjected to criticism). While there is a fair amount to
glean from all of the material, one of the main The prospect of
software tools composed with uniform pipes offered an approach which
could be more quickly produced, more readily evolved, and was more
able to tap portable background knowledge. As alluded to the
discussion is a bit more nuanced and as one of my former coworkers
posited that argument is on much shakier ground when considering a
system such as TeX (and I personally am a proponent of literate
programming), but it is worth recognizing that all too often
programming languages seem to drift towards such monolithic
recreations of functionality which could otherwise be more readily
composed. From a more modern perspective many of the software tools
ideas carry forward to pursuits such as microservices&#x2026;or less
ambitiously any use of well designed utility containers.

<h2 id="org1792221"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> The What and the How</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
At its core, programming is largely about algorithms which are the
imperative complement to declarative knowledge. A clear and often
used example (I think it appears in sources such as The Art of
Computer Programming and The Go Programming Language) is <span class="underline">how</span>
Euclid's Algorithm can be coded to determine <span class="underline">what</span> is the greatest
common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.  The GCD is an important declared
concept and the automation of how to derive the appropriate value is
enormously valuable.
</p>

<p>
While automating such processes is the core value of computers, one of
the most valuable tools in engineering is that of
abstraction. Abstraction is essential for making systems
comprehensible and while it is crucial in all fields of engineering,
it is integral to software engineering - not only is the base level of
software engineering built atop many layers of electrical engineering
abstractions, but the creation of abstractions is one of the core
tools of software engineers. Abstraction effectively buries the
previously mentioned core value of computing. Drawing on the earlier
example - while the value of <span class="underline">computers</span> is the automation of the <span class="underline">how</span>
of Euclid's Algorithm, the value delivered by the software is that of
producing the <span class="underline">what</span> of the GCD. Therefore the produced machine is
most simply represented as a <span class="underline">what</span> producing black box so the GCD and
any other relevant pieces of data can be used without getting swamped
in details.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately languages are often too focused on aspects of <span class="underline">how</span> -
all too often there are established and abstracted solutions for
particular problems but all too often significant additional effort is
required to re-implement or adapt such solutions so that they conform
with <span class="underline">how</span> a particular language seeks to express ideas within the
solution space. This perspective in isolation is a bit simplistic but
will be elaborated upon further.

<div id="outline-container-org6264428" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6264428"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Systems vs. Application Programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
A key distinction when discussing programming is that between systems
programming and application programming. The official definitions
should be incorporated here, but for in the short term I'll consider
systems programming as that which is focused on enabling use of
relatively primitive technical constructs. At the lowest level this
involves things like hardware and instruction sets but more typically
this is likely to make use of the facilities provided by the operating
system or higher level of abstraction such as virtual machines. The
output of systems programming is likely to be a generalized machine.
</p>

<p>
Applications programming is developing software to solve specific
business cases&#x2026;which is the vast majority of modern software being
created. Drawing on Fred Brooks's "No Silver Bullet", the vast
majority of concerns introduced by software in applications
programming amount to accidental complexity: friction which is
introduced by the solution space where only a small amount is likely
to be an essential consideration for the problem at
hand. Unfortunately software engineers seem to gravitate towards
challenges that may be technically interesting but have unclear
business value. A basic smell test for such considerations is whether
their removal would confer a competitive advantage - if you're
investing in establishing deep technical expertise but a competitor
made use of an alternative which avoided that overhead would they be
able to undercut you? If that resonates then it is a strong indication
of an accretion of accidental complexity which is likely to escalate
both delivery and maintenance costs. No-code, low-code, and
ML-assisted development may help reduce smooth out some of these edges
but a far more fundamental adjustment is simply to recognize the
difference between systems and application programming and the natural
corollary that unless your core deliverable is software itself rather
than the output of such software, any and all effort expended in
producing such output with the desired characteristics is cost and
should be managed appropriately.
</p>

<p>
There's a larger thread lurking within this sentiment around
accountability and how perverse some routine engineering efforts would
seem if analogs within other departments existed but are accepted in
the magical world of software, but that's likely a larger topic. Much
of this ties directly back to the concepts in The What and the How:
application programming is best expressed entirely in terms of
<span class="underline">what<sub>s</sub>. Preferring more declarative interfaces can make machines far
more economical to develop and easier to reason about, verify, and
optimize. Most application programming, however, tends to remain
largely imperative without a clear delineation from systems
programming. This break is certainly not a clearly achievable goal and
is likely to echo the largely unrealized dream of fourth generation
languages, _but</span> a key distinction in this thread is that the focus is
emphatically not about pursuing a language but rather reuse and
composition of abstractions. This also touches back upon Software
Tools and Monoliths and echoes some of Martin Kleppmann's sentiments
at the end of <a href="sources.html#ddia">Desiging Data-Intensive Applications</a> which imagines
being able to compose data flows as easily as Unix pipelines.

<div id="outline-container-orgf0f0cf4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf0f0cf4"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Underlying Concerns</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The previous ideas stay pretty conceptual but all of these ideas need
to meet the metal at some point and some of the things that have been
glossed over warrant some attention.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps one of the first places to start is that much of the described
interoperability is available in the form of foreign function
interfaces&#x2026;but foreign? If two languages are running on the same
system what is foreign? This cuts back to the Python SSL code that
pushed me over this ledge - why was so much code necessary to call a
library that I could easily interact with from the command line?
</p>

<p>
One of the clearest initial issues is the representation of data
within any given language. Most instruction sets operate on bits and
while they may care about the number of bits involved they are far
less likely to care about what the bits mean; semantics that extend
beyond basics such as a sign bit are likely to be largely handled by
convention. While low level languages like C provide some behavior on
top of this such behavior is largely in the compiler so the data
worked with is still largely bits rather than having any particularly
defined metadata. As most major operating systems are written in a C
compatible language this leaves higher level languages to track what
additional data they need either alongside the data itself or in
separate structures, establishing local conventions which then need a
translation layer for "foreign" data.
</p>

<p>
A related but arguably less fundamental concern is around some of the
additional behavior provided by particular languages. Concerns such as
memory management or safety may require that any data which is not
provided through standard channels must be somehow taken into the
fold. This is significant but ultimately this should correspond to
some combination of the aforementioned metadata and perhaps a function
invocation. There are certainly stickier considerations if data is
registered for such functionality while remaining accessible to
external code, but those are detail devils that are ultimately the
result of some of the initial practices which are being questioned (if
such functionality were detached from some notion of "language" then
the foreign/external boundary disappears).
</p>

<p>
When considering established approaches such as Unix pipelines another
concern is that of inter-process communication (IPC). Consistently
sharing data by value is wonderfully simple&#x2026;but can be fairly
costly. The same concern manifests in microservices and the goals of
GNU Hurd. On a given system this is another incarnation of the
previous concern: any perceived <span class="underline">requirement</span> that the value must be
handled in a particular way is the result of it crossing some
potentially arbitrary boundary.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb6aa6cd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb6aa6cd"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> Where This Leads</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
I'll be exploring some of the options with some of the ideas above,
much of this circles around the notion of relying upon an established
low level interface to avoid some of the translation boundaries, where
the clearest initial such interface would be the SysV ABI. Particular
features of given languages would be implemented independently of the
language itself, and the means of expression which often seem to
dominate current languages would be a layer on top of all of these
(like a lightweight compiler front end). This will probably result
primarily in adoption of tools which match these goals (I feel like I
may be getting pulled toward C++) with some gaps filled by some
homemade glue (particularly for some of the additional tastes like
literate programming).
