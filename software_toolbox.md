### [bash](bash)

### nano 

[Nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano "GNU nano - Wikipedia"){data-atime="2024-07-11"} is
currently my default text editor. I'm drawn to it in that it is focused and readily
configured to operate within a Software Tools model where fairly sophisticated behavior
could be defined in the form of calls to external command flows. The
[source code](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/nano.git/log/ "nano.git - GNU nano") is
very clean and readable, and I'm also likely to ultimately create my own toy version
of it to make it a bit more extensible, support personal conventions, and just to
play around with technologies.

### twidlk

I have a Twiddler 3 keyer that I picked up several years ago.
I'm currently starting with
[twidlk](https://github.com/edanaher/twidlk "edanaher/twidlk: A CLI for working with Twiddler configurations"){atime="2024-09-13"}
to manage the configuration. Somewhat coincidentally I started
a similar project shortly after getting the keyer which was also in
Haskell but was using Aeson to produce the output
(it would be more suprising if it didn't seem like the type of people
using keyers would also be likely to find Haskell appealing).
I'll like push an updated fork soonish.

## Dormant

### emacs

[Emacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs "Emacs - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-04-30"}
is a tool I keep crawling back to.
For the time being I'll be using it as my primary baseline for interactions,
but that may be revisited if other pieces start to snap
together. In particular I'm currently using the emacs-ng fork.
