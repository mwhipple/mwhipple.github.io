title: Perl

- [Up to Programming Languages](programming_languages)

I gravitated towards Perl around the year 2000 likely
due to both the wide availability of the language and
the relative maturity of CPAN at the time.

I think I was ultimately disillusioned a bit by my
perception that the TIMTOWTDI mentality introduced
signific fragmentation within the ecosystem. I'm
overdue to take an updated look. If nothing else
I'm due to re-read Perl Best Practices since from what I
remember the assertions within that book make it worth
going through regardless of your chosen language.
