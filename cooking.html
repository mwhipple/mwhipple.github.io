I certainly appreciate good food and drink and worked in restaurants for a fair amount of time.
While I've thrown together decent meals over the years I've also recently started to pay
closer attention to cooking.
</p><p>
Part of this effort also involves selecting and caring for decent equipment. I've been gradually
upgrading my gear while making sure I can actually appreciate the difference. I recently
acquired a cast-iron skillet from my father, and after using it the difference compared to the
relatively cheap skillets I otherwise had was dramatic. The seasoning kept food sliding right
off and the more even cooking from the higher heat capacity iron was a glaring difference.
</p><p>
Unfortunately while leaving it to dry on the stove I got
distracted by noticing some water under the kitchen sink...long enough for the seasoning
to largely burn off. I'm now looking to reseason it...which can also hopefully lead me
to getting around to seasoning my wok which I haven't done as I primarily use it for
steaming vegetables. The first instructions for reseasoning I found are

I'm not sure what oils have a sufficiently high oleic index, but for the first attempt I don't have
Canola oil in a usable form but have some vegetable oil so I'll start with that (and capture the
index for it later). I also used a microfiober cloth to cover the skillet which may have been a
bit too absorbent so I'd probably use something else the next time around.
</p><p>
The first attempt didn't quite work - my guess is that the isse was the cloth so I'm trying
again and this time using a (bamboo) paper towel and some high smoke point oil that's a mix
of safflower, avocado, and coconut. This time I foolishly hijacked the oven at an inopportune
time and therefore may need to cut the time short, but hopefully it's close enough.
