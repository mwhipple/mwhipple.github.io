I certainly appreciate good food and drink and worked in restaurants for a fair amount of time.
While I've thrown together decent meals over the years I've also recently started to pay
closer attention to cooking.

Part of this effort also involves selecting and caring for decent equipment. I recently
acquired a cast-iron skillet from my father and while leaving it to dry on the stove I got
distracted by noticing some water under the kitchen sink...long enough for the seasoning
to largely burn off. I'm now looking to reseason it...which can also hopefully lead me
to getting around to seasoning my wok which I haven't done as I primarily use it for
steaming vegetables. The first instructions for reseasoning I found are

I'm not sure what oils have a sufficiently high oleic index, but for the first attempt I don't have
Canola oil in a usable form but have some vegetable oil so I'll start with that (and capture the
index for it later). I also used a microfiober cloth to cover the skillet which may have been a
bit too absorbent so I'd probably use something else the next time around.
