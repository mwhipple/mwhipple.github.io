I strive to adopt sustainable practices, which for me largely amounts
to reduction and simplification. There seems to be an unfortunate tension
between sustainability and consumerism which leads to implication that
sustainability should be layered on top of existing consumption and
messages around reduction being buried or spun. This can translate into not
only a house of cards in the service of seeking to enable existing patterns
but worse scenarios such as encouraging replacement of existing products
with those that may be more efficient products without a path to amortize
production impacts (not to say there aren't cases where such amortization is evident).
I tend to pursue such goals
through tuning of my actions rather than anything more comprehensively aggressive.

I try to consume from companies that support this goal, both those that are local
and aligned with many of the values. As a disclaimer most such assessments are done
based on last mile assessments - there are certainly plenty of places where such
assessments may not be accurate but I don't have the expertise or capacity to
perform more complete analysis of concerns like supply chains and adjust my
purchasing accordingly. I do incorporate any such information I find out and
expect such evident value alignment to translate up the chain at least insofar
as misalignments are more likely to bubble up (i.e. it is far more likely that
interesting information would be revealed if it is inconsistent with a vendor's
image).

One particular value I'm pursuing currently is plastic neutrality. While fields
as medicine can likely benefit from plastics they are ubiquiotus and raise
concerns both in the form of non-renewable materials for manufacturing
(specific petroleum) and in degrading to
