      <h1>Agile</h1>
    </header>
    <p>As I'd guess most software professionals have been, I've been subjected
    to range of Agile practices, where I tend to use the capital "A" in
    relation to some of the packaged frameworks and the lower case "agile" to
    represent the property which those frameworks are purportedly trying to
    enable.</p>
    <p>I've overall been fortunate in that I've only been subjected to an
    invasion of consultants once, and have otherwise been in a position where I
    have been able to establish pragmatic and healthy working contracts.</p>
    <p>Overall I tend to think that the ideas underlying Agile are sound and
    have a solid background (a history that is often ignored), but more often
    than not the ideas seem to get abused (especially when dressed up as simple
    solutions to complex problems) and concepts from the <a href=

    manifesto</a> seemingly get

    even though it seems short enough that no
    content should be ignored lightly.</p>
