[Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) "Bash (Unix shell) - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-07-29"}
 is my current shell, as it seems to remain the de facto standard
shell in linux environments (such as containers).

Bash has certainly accumulated a fair amount of warts over the years
(in addition to quirks that seem a natural consequence of offering a shell
and a language)
and I also may have a background desire to shift from what a specialized
shell to more of a general purpose REPL with appropriate extensions...
or perhaps more likely seek an alternative interaction model altogether, but
bash knowledge tends to remain valuable and something I make use of heavily
and therefore it is unlikely to go away (if anything I'll likely explore
a leaner alternative that provides a subset of compatible behavior).
