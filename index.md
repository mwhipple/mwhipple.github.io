My general sentiment towards this site is similar to that expressed by
Tim Berners-Lee in the
[W3C Design Issues Preface.](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Preface.html "Preface - World Wide Web Design Issues"){atime="2024-04-17"}
Sections may also serve as somewhat of an unformal and disorganized
[lab notebook](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3631181 "Dear Diary - ACM Queue"){atime="2024-06-07"}.
