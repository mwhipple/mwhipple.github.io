				<h1>Food</h1>

			<p>
				I've recently started to pay closer attention to food sourcing and preparation.
				Likely the most significant impacts are from pursuing plastic neutrality, which at least
				in my location is very limiting in that plastic packaging for food seems widespread.
				I also prefer local foods though for most cases this seems far more straightforward than
				plastic avoidance.
				This page is currently just a dumping ground of information and lists that will be cleaned
				up as I go.

						The recipe on the

						   title="Recipe for Taco Seasoning: How to Make Taco Seasoning | McCormick"
						   data-atime="2024-05-30">McCormick site</a>
						was the first one I stumbled across when trying to throw some seasoning together.
						That is was paprika-heavy seemed like a safe bet given that my children are not yet
						ready for too much spice and it was well received so this is my current go-to recipe.
						I tend to go light on the salt and otherwise measure everything by weight with the
						translation of grams that are equal to two times the listed teaspoons
						(i.e. 1.5tsp -> 3g), which is almost certainly not quite the same ratios but it
						satisfies the main goal of taco night which is to appease my kids.
