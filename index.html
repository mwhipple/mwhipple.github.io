<div class="overview">

  <h1>Home</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the latest iteration of my Web site.</p>

  <p>I'll be copying information from previous incarnations.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>Information Collection</h2>

  <p>
    To gamify information consumption in the interest of this site a bit for myself
    I'm going to look to use only information which is navigable from source that I've read
    (rather than from issuing a search).
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the initial roots for the search will be Martin Kleppmann's excellent
    <a href="#src-ddai">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> which is not only a great resource
    by itself but also a treasure trove of useful references. In addition to this
    I'll be using books that I have or discover at libraries and information read
    from assorted memberships to O'Reilly, ACM, IEEE and the New York Times.
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>Software Selectiom</h2>

  <p>
    The software used will also be driven by what can be discovered through navigation,
    with a useful initial directory being provided by the <a href="#src-gnumanuals">GNU Manuals</a>.
    (and a more comprehensive selection in the linked Free Software Directory which will be
    explored to fill possible gaps).
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>Markup</h2>

  <p>
    The initial markup will start by stealing basic practices from sources used, so far:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#src-gnucoreutils_manual">GNU Coreutils Manual</a></li>
      <li><a href="$src-github_blog">GitHub Blog</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>GitHub</h2>

  <p>
    Initially the source for this site will be hosted on GitHub. I personally have more interest in some other alternatives
    which I'll look to explore for any projects that I publish, but GitHub is what I'm currently using for work and also
    is the most readily navigable service from my Information Collection approach, starting with some GitHub blog posts.
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>GitHub Pages</h2>

  <p>
    This site will first be hosted on <a href="#github_blog_pages">GitHub Pages</a>. This is a solid option overall and
    one I've used in the past. I will likely be looking to move away from it for reasons that will be elucidated if and
    when that happens (nothing overly important).
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>Artanis</h2>

  <p>
    This site will be looking to be running on top of <a href="#src-gnuartanis">GNU Artanis</a>. This is largely a consequence
    of the approach to Information Collection, although the project may potentially align with some longer term goals.
    I'm more likely to ultimately land on a solution that is more closely aligned with a static Web site/JAM stack,
    but I think I also want the site to have some basic support for concepts such as content negotiation which many static
    solutions don't lend themselves naturally to and therefore I'll probably ultimately move to something like nginx
    (which is also recommended in front of Artanis but I haven't navigated my way over there yet).
  </p>

  <p>
    Relatively up-to-date information on Artanis seems to be provided on its <a href="#src-artanis_github">GitLab page</a>
    (including containerized execution which I'll be looking to build on top of).
  </p>

  <p>
    Artanis itself is built on top of <a href="#src-gnuguile">GNU Guile</a> which was installed but not detected on my system
    (it is potentially outdated), so I may also dig into that project though I'll likely start with seeing about containerized
    Artanis.
  </p>
