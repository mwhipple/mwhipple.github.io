    <p>Welcome to my Web site.</p>
    <p>My general sentiment towards this site is similar to that expressed by
    Tim Berners-Lee in the <a href=

    "Preface - World Wide Web Design Issues" data-atime="2024-04-17">W3C Design

    Sections may also serve as somewhat of an unformal and disorganized <a href=

    "Dear Diary - ACM Queue" data-atime="2024-06-07">lab notebook</a>.</p>

    <p>Around Sat Mar 30 05:30:23 AM EDT 2024 my laptop would not start in the
    morning There was charge remaining and it went through GRUB and loading
    hibernation but the screen threafter was blank.</p>
    <p>The first bit of content will concern the construction of the site
    itself, which can be viewed in the <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a>.</p>
    <p>About Me</p>
    <p>By profession I'm a software engineer/architect and typically spend my
    days shepherding large scale <a href=
    "https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2482856" title=
    "There’s Just No Getting around It: You’re Building a Distributed System - ACM Queue"
    data-date="2024-02-14">distributed cloud systems</a>. Outside of that I'm
    somewhat of a minimalist who pursues <a href=
    "sustainability">sustainability</a>, a husband, father, musician, <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism" title="Empricism - Wikipedia"
    data-date="2024-02-02">empiricist</a>, and someone who needs to devote time
    to a wider range of hobbies.</p>
    <p>Some more information about software will be tracked <a href=
    "software">here</a></p>
    <p>On January 25, 2024 this site seemed to be unresponsive starting at
    ~07:30 ET. Requests would result in a 500 error. The traffic itself seemed
    to not be reaching the application instances which to me suggests an issue
    with either the load balancer or some of the Knative/Cloud Run machinery
    (possibly related to cold starts). There was no obvious cause for this
    change based on the logs nor was the application reporting an issue.
    Restoring a previous revision and creating a new revision using the same
    image both resolved the issue so it is optimistically going to be ignored
    for the time being as a fluke. If it recurs further investigation will be
    done and information recorded (determing where the error itself is being
    thrown should indicate where there is undesirable state...presumably things
    getting stuck).</p>
    <p>I also deploy my <a href="https://music.mattwhipple.com">site for
    music</a> to GCP, though that is currently using Hugo pushing to <a href=
    "https://cloud.google.com/storage" title="Cloud Storage | Google Cloud"
    data-date="2024-02-19">Cloud Storage</a>. When I initially set it up I
    configured it for global access, but have since realized that costs me a
    small amount monthly... at the moment I'm not expecting the site to be
    covering any expenses and I'm not delusional enough to expect to need
    global coverage so I've gone back to reconfigure it to reduce such costs.
    It's certainly still not costly, but I'd expect these sites to typically
    fit comfortably within free'ish tiers.</p>
    <p>After the costs have continued it certainly appears as though the
    readily supported combination of load balancers and object storage preclude
    free tier use, so I'll likely adjust the site to use Cloud Run similar to
    this one.</p>
    <p>Replacing the load balancer with a regional configuration would
    hopefully reduce the costs (I did knock the site offline for a brief period
    but continuing from the above this was unlikely to have any consequence for
    this site) but as of right now I'm still getting dinged for some lingering
    resources. I tracked down a static IP that needed to be removed, and there
    were also some lingering forwarding rules. I'll have to check the billing
    (or just wait a month to see if I'm still getting charged).</p>
