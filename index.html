<p>Welcome to my Web site.</p>

<p>This site will reflect building some things from the ground up.
The first bit of content will concern the construction of the site itself,
which can be viewed in the <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a>.</p>

<p>About Me</p>

<p>By profession I'm a software engineer/architect and typically spend my days
shepherding large scale distributed cloud systems. Outside of that I'm a
minimalist who pursues sustainability: a husband, father, musician, empiricist,
and somehow who needs to devote time to a wider range of hobbies.</p>
