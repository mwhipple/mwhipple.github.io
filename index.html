<p>Welcome to my Web site.</p>

<p>This site will reflect building some things from the ground up.
The first bit of content will concern the construction of the site itself,
which can be viewed in the <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a>.</p>

<p>About Me</p>

<p>By profession I'm a software engineer/architect and typically spend my days
shepherding large scale distributed cloud systems. Outside of that I'm a
minimalist who pursues sustainability: a husband, father, musician, empiricist,
and somehow who needs to devote time to a wider range of hobbies.</p>

<p>Some more information about software will be tracked
<a href="software.html">here</a></p>

<p>On January 25, 2024 this siste seemed to be unresponsive starting at ~07:30 ET.
Requests would result in a 500 error. The traffic itself seemed to not be
reaching the application instances which to me suggests an issue with either
the load balancer or some of the Knative/Cloud Run machinery (possibly related
to cold starts). There was no obvious cause for this change based on the logs nor was the
application reporting an issue. Restoring a previous revision and creating a new revision
using the same image both resolved the issue so it is optimistically going to be ignored
for the time being as a fluke. If it recurs further investigation will be done and information
recorded (determing where the error itself is being thrown should indicate where there is
undesirable state...presumably things getting stuck).</p>
