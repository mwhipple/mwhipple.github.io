<div class="overview">

  <h1>Home</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the latest iteration of my Web site.</p>

  <p>I'll be copying information from previous incarnations.</p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>Information Collection</h2>

  <p>
    To gamify information consumption in the interest of this site a bit for myself
    I'm going to look to use only information which is navigable from source that I've read
    (rather than from issuing a search).
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the initial roots for the search will be Martin Kleppmann's excellent
    <a href="#src-ddai">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> which is not only a great resource
    by itself but also a treasure trove of useful references. In addition to this
    I'll be using books that I have or discover at libraries and information read
    from assorted memberships to O'Reilly, ACM, IEEE and the New York Times.
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>Software Selection</h2>

  <p>
    The software used will also be driven by what can be discovered through navigation,
    with a useful initial directory being provided by the <a href="#src-gnumanuals">GNU Manuals</a>.
    (and a more comprehensive selection in the linked Free Software Directory which will be
    explored to fill possible gaps).
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>Markup</h2>

  <p>
    The initial markup will start by stealing basic practices from sources used, so far:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#src-gnucoreutils_manual">GNU Coreutils Manual</a></li>
      <li><a href="$src-github_blog">GitHub Blog</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>GitHub</h2>

  <p>
    Initially the source for this site will be hosted on GitHub. I personally have more interest in some other alternatives
    which I'll look to explore for any projects that I publish, but GitHub is what I'm currently using for work and also
    is the most readily navigable service from my Information Collection approach, starting with some GitHub blog posts.
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>GitHub Pages</h2>

  <p>
    This site will first be hosted on <a href="#github_blog_pages">GitHub Pages</a>. This is a solid option overall and
    one I've used in the past. I will likely be looking to move away from it for reasons that will be elucidated if and
    when that happens (nothing overly important).
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>Google App Engine</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="#src-gae">Google App Engine</a> is a viable hosting option that came up fairly early in my information navigation
    and seems to potentially fit the right set of criteria. Google Cloud is also a technology I'll be using for work and one which I
    haven't spent too much time (like much of the industry I'm far more comfortable with AWS).
  </p>

  <p>
    I used and evangelized GAE a fair amount quite a while ago (prior to and during the period when it went General Availability),
    and would be likely to use it again if I were looking to develop an appropriate app. While I'm currently looking to use the
    flexible model for containerized deployment I've generally been of the mindset that adapting designs to fit within the constraints
    of systems like GAE can provide significant upfront benefits. Typically the aversion to such technologies that I've seen seems to be
    a fixed mindset where people are turned off that they can't use their preferred hammers, which isn't to say that that isn't often
    a compelling reason, particularly for an organization. Similarly there may be some cases for which a particular type of technology
    is most appropriate but an awkward fit. Additionally I haven't run the numbers for GAE in particular but in most
    similar systems there's a breakeven point after which it is likely to be far more cost effective to use something closer to the
    metal even after accounting for the operational overhead. But...as mentioned the <em>upfront</em> benefits can be substantial and
    other than cultural resistance (which isn't a concern for my personal projects) many of the other concerns are initially aspirational.
  </p>

</div>

<div class="section">

  <h2>Artanis</h2>

  <p>
    This site will be looking to be running on top of <a href="#src-gnuartanis">GNU Artanis</a>. This is largely a consequence
    of the approach to Information Collection, although the project may potentially align with some longer term goals.
    I'm more likely to ultimately land on a solution that is more closely aligned with a static Web site/JAM stack,
    but I think I also want the site to have some basic support for concepts such as content negotiation which many static
    solutions don't lend themselves naturally to and therefore I'll probably ultimately move to something like nginx
    (which is also recommended in front of Artanis but I haven't navigated my way over there yet).
  </p>

  <p>
    Relatively up-to-date information on Artanis seems to be provided on its <a href="#src-artanis_github">GitLab page</a>
    (including containerized execution which I'll be looking to build on top of).
  </p>

  <p>
    Artanis itself is built on top of <a href="#src-gnuguile">GNU Guile</a> which was installed but not detected on my system
    (it is potentially outdated), so I may also dig into that project though I'll likely start with seeing about containerized
    Artanis.
  </p>

  <h3>Containerized Execution</h3>

  <p>
    I'll be looking to run Artanis in a container, and accordingly the initially desired development environment is also
    using containers to most closely align with the deployment (installing anything on my host is effectively more of a
    workflow optimization). There are <a href="#src-nalaginrut-artanis-docker">some instructions</a> provided for running
    Artanis in a container, but those instructions need to be tuned a bit. Most significantly the tag for the image is
    outdated and should instead be more of the form <code>registry.gitlab.com/hardenedlinux/artanis</code> to reflect the
    project being transferred. Beyond that there are a few adjustments for the sake of usability and reproducibility:
    the image should have an appropriate entrypoint so that it can be launched directly and an ostensibly immutable tag
    should be used (where the latter concern transcends the scope of the blog post). The entrypoint decision is somewhat
    a matter of preference or perspective where the instructions seem to be more oriented towards using the container to
    provide an interactive contained environment which takes care of dependencies whereas my preference would be more of a directly
    invokable utility container which is more targeted towards providing a service to the host (where the entrypoint can
    always be overridden if needed). I'll therefore likely create an image for local development which adjusts the entrypoint
    whereas I'd typically look to just use the upstream image for that purpose (along with expected tweaks to the command.
    There's also a decent chance the image could be slimmed down a bit if it's not expected to be interactive, but it doesn't
    seem <em>overly</em> large given the use case and so that feels like premature optimization for the time being
    (it seems unnecessarily large given the functionality for a deployment that is expected to scale but I presently have no reason to
    think this site fits that criterion).
  </p>

  <p>
    Another fairly general note is that the guidance on the post suggests using <a href="#src-docker-get"><code>docker</code></a>
    but I'd probably gravitate towards an alternative like <code>nerdctl</code>. This is relatively insignificant as it can be abstracted
    by the Makefile but seems worth mentioning given the strong sentiment in the Artanis documentation and the GNU
    community as a whole towards free software against which the licensing for Docker Desktop <em>may</em> run afoul
    (though my personal system is Linux which is currently running Docker).
  </p>

  <h4>Details</h4>

  <p>
    My starting point is to use the provided image and access a locally running site...unforutnately some of my quick tweaks didn't
    quite land so I'll need to quickly retrieve specifics from the <a href="#src-docker-reference">Docker reference documentation</a>
    since I typically can remember what options there are but not quite how they look. While I (as mentioned) am looking to move away
    from Docker it has good documentation and remains the de facto standard at the moment so starting with what is documented for Docker
    is certainly a safe point while pursuing what is currently Docker-compatible invocations.
