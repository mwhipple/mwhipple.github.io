      Welcome to my Web site.

    Around Sat Mar 30 05:30:23 AM EDT 2024 my laptop would not start in the morning
    There was charge remaining and it went through GRUB and loading hibernation but
    the screen threafter was blank.

    This site will reflect building some things from the ground up.
    This also serves as somewhat of an unformal and disorganized

The first bit of content will concern the construction of the site itself,
which can be viewed in the <a href="Makefile">Makefile</a>.</p>

<p>About Me</p>

<p>By profession I'm a software engineer/architect and typically spend my days
shepherding large scale
<a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2482856"
   title="There’s Just No Getting around It: You’re Building a Distributed System - ACM Queue"
   data-date="2024-02-14">distributed cloud systems</a>.
Outside of that I'm somewhat of a
minimalist who pursues
<a href="sustainability">sustainability</a>,
a husband, father, musician,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism"
   title="Empricism - Wikipedia"
   data-date="2024-02-02">empiricist</a>,
and someone who needs to devote time to a wider range of hobbies.</p>

<p>Some more information about software will be tracked
<a href="software">here</a>
</p>

<p>On January 25, 2024 this site seemed to be unresponsive starting at ~07:30 ET.
Requests would result in a 500 error. The traffic itself seemed to not be
reaching the application instances which to me suggests an issue with either
the load balancer or some of the Knative/Cloud Run machinery (possibly related
to cold starts). There was no obvious cause for this change based on the logs nor was the
application reporting an issue. Restoring a previous revision and creating a new revision
using the same image both resolved the issue so it is optimistically going to be ignored
for the time being as a fluke. If it recurs further investigation will be done and information
recorded (determing where the error itself is being thrown should indicate where there is
undesirable state...presumably things getting stuck).</p>

<p>
I also deploy my
<a href="https://music.mattwhipple.com">site for music</a>
to GCP, though
that is currently using Hugo pushing to
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage"
   title=""Cloud Storage | Google Cloud"
   data-date="2024-02-19">Cloud Storage</a>.
When I initially set it up I
configured it for global access, but have since realized that costs me a small amount monthly...
at the moment I'm not expecting the site to be covering any expenses and I'm not delusional
enough to expect to need global coverage so I've gone back to reconfigure it to reduce such costs.
It's certainly still not costly, but I'd expect these sites to typically fit comfortably within
free'ish tiers.
</p><p>
After the costs have continued it certainly appears as though the readily supported combination
of load balancers and object storage preclude free tier use, so I'll likely adjust the site to
use Cloud Run similar to this one.
</p><p>
Replacing the load balancer with a regional configuration would hopefully reduce the costs
(I did knock the site offline for a brief period but continuing from the above this was unlikely to have
any consequence for this site)
but as of right now I'm still getting dinged for some lingering resources. I tracked down a static
IP that needed to be removed, and there were also some lingering forwarding rules. I'll have to
check the billing (or just wait a month to see if I'm still getting charged).
