title: Knowledge Portability

- [Up to Home](./)

One principle that I always try enstill in organizations is what I tend
to call "knowledge portability"...the ease by which knowledge moves through
the organization. While any healthy organization seeks to avoid knowledge
siloes, I find the above term as a nice framing for some prospective issues
with more common phrases.

Knowledge _transfer_ is likely the most glaringly problematic but typically
essential concept; this typically reflects that the organization is
dodging buses and there is knowledge that is held within heads that are
thankfully being made less available due to more controlled and less violent
transitions.

Similar concerns may arise with knowledge _sharing_ depending on how its done;
if it's a regular enough practice then you may end up with a high enough bus
factor that this can amount to tribal knowledge where those in the know at least
know whom to ask...but without more durable capturing and distillation this is
at best likely to lead to high onboarding overhead and atrophy over time.

Knowledge _bases_ and other forms of capture are certainly good things to have,
so long as the information is discoverable and digestible. Challenges with
many such systems is not having a clear audience or relationship with other
sources of information.

To be clear, all of the above can be very useful approaches but should consistently
guaged in terms of the larger question of how freely knowledge flows through
an organization; how can different people be empowered with different types of
information. Addressing this is by no means a simple endeavor but should be
given significant amounts of ongoing attention rather than settling on any
particular state especially when considering different people's preferences
and learning styles. This is essential for scalable
