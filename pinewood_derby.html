My two children are currently in Cub Scouts and participate in the annual
pinewood derby which leaves me to stumble through trying to help make their cars.
</p><p>
I have strong memories of building cars with my father. My cars were consistently
some of the best in the pack so my room had several resulting trophies (at least one first
place). My father had a nice woodworking setup in our basement and corresponding experience,
though my primary memory is spending what felt like a long time sanding and using hand tools
after which he'd use power tools to have far more effect in far less time. Things have
also changed significantly since then as information on the Internet and a cottage industry
for gear have led to cars which would likely leave the cars I had made in the dust.
</p><p>
At the moment I don't have much of a workshop at all, and instead have a pile of
unsorted inherited equipment with little supporting knowledge and a small corner
of my basement somewhat cleared out. I generally want to make sure my children are
more active participants than I likely was, and I also don't want to lean on
specialized equipment since that seems to me to possibly invlalidate the 
original spirit of the pinewood derby and also goes against some of my minimalist
ideology. For making the cars in general it seems as though hand tools should
mostly be sufficient and more accessible for children, with the exception of
drilling since hand drilling is a pain (I may pursue this for some other projects,
but for this it would just be a recipe in frustration. I do however purchase some
more tailored supplies such as weights.
</p><p>
This page acts to capture some of my discoveries and progress year to year in the hopes
to improve over time. Last year was the first year with only a single car and my
primary goal was that the car would make it down the track in one piece. It performed
just above average - enough to make it into the finals and then pretty much lose
every race there. The car itself was cut and then weights were mostly just plopped
on top in mount of tungesten putty. My son only wanted to color it with markers so
it certainly didn't look particularly good. Looking at the car this year I also
noticed that while the axles were bent, the bend did not seem to be enough to
leave the wheels properly cambered.
</p><p>
This year unforutnately the flu worked its way through my family right before
the derby, and so preparation was delayed and then squeezed in to the week days
prior to the race.
</p><p>
Cutting the cars was done with a hack saw, particularly
given the child participation some of the cuts ended up less than straight
(not that I'm adept at straight cuts) and so I'll probably look at picking up a
mitre box for next year.
</p><p>
Both cars were current with very little height which left both less weight
and less space in which to inconspicuously add weight. For one of the cars
I drilled out a hole using the largest drill bit I had on hand...I have
some larger hole cutters but I couldn't quickly find them and they may have
needed more depth to work effectively regardless. I then ended up using
a hammer and chisel to widen the hole to a rectangle large enough to hold
enough weight (weights and putty) and deep enough so that the result was
fairly flush. For the other car I drilled out three 3/8" holes which
are the right size for stacks of weights and added weights along with
some putty to those holes along with some weighted tape which was
cut roughly in half and stacked on top of itself.
</p><p>
I quickly attempted to smooth out the wheels using sandpaper and
a drill, this is something that I'll probably look at paying closer
attention to next year as I didn't use some of the additional supplies
which are sometimes mentioned, and I had mixed luck in making sure
the wheels were held tight enought to rotate.
</p><p>
Polishing the axles is something I did last year with unclear benefit.
Similar to the above I may want to get some actual polish, but this year
I'll do the same tehnique I did last year of clamping the drill and
taping the trigger, and then using sandpaper against the axles.
Last year I think I just used dry sandpaper but this year I'm doing

   data-date="2024-02-02">wet sanding</a>
based on advice found on the interwebs, with a ladder of 
1500, 2500, and 3000 grit since that's what I readily found for
fairly fine papers.
</p><p>
This year I improved the process a bit by noticing a nearby strap wrench
that I'd acquired at some point over the years, which provided a far more
efficient route than the tape - simply tightening and loosening the wrench
to turn the drill on and off respectively. I also luckily found a file nearby
which I could use to smooth out the head, and I added a couple steps of
600 and 800 grit dry sanding before the wet...I'm not sure whether this had
impact (most of this is pretty speculative without some kind of metric) but
I added this additional step when noticing some of the remaining marks on the
axle...but those marks still remained after doing ten seconds each of filing the
head, the shaft, and using each of the five papers. After doing that for the
eight axles I'm pretty much out of time regardless.
