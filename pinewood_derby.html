My two children are currently in Cub Scouts and participate in the annual
pinewood derby which leaves me to stumble through trying to help make their cars.
</p><p>
I have strong memories of building cars with my father. My cars were consistently
some of the best in the pack so my room had several resulting trophies (at least one first
place). My father had a nice woodworking setup in our basement and corresponding experience,
though my primary memory is spending what felt like a long time sanding and using hand tools
after which he'd use power tools to have far more effect in far less time. Things have
also changed significantly since then as information on the Internet and a cottage industry
for gear have led to cars which would likely leave the cars I had made in the dust.

At the moment I don't have much of a workshop at all, and instead have a pile of
unsorted inherited equipment with little supporting knowledge and a small corner
of my basement somewhat cleared out. I generally want to make sure my children are
more active participants than I likely was, and I also don't want to lean on
specialized equipment since that seems to me to possibly invlalidate the 
original spirit of the pinewood derby and also goes against some of my minimalist
ideology. For making the cars in general it seems as though hand tools should
mostly be sufficient and more accessible for children, with the exception of
drilling since hand drilling is a pain (I may pursue this for some other projects,
but for this it would just be a recipe in frustration. I do however purchase some
more tailored supplies such as weights.

This page acts to capture some of my discoveries and progress year to year in the hopes
to improve over time. Last year was the first year with only a single car and my
primary goal was that the car would make it down the track in one piece. It performed
just above average - enough to make it into the finals and then pretty much lose
every race there. The car itself was cut and then weights were mostly just plopped
on top in mount of tungesten putty. My son only wanted to color it with markers so
it certainly didn't look particularly good. Looking at the car this year I also
noticed that while the axles were bent, the bend did not seem to be enough to
leave the wheels properly cambered.

This year both of my children cut their cars very thin which complicated
adding of weight. The cuts themselves were done with a hack saw, particularly
given the child participation some of the cuts ended up less than straight
(not that I'm adept at straight cuts) and so I'll probably look at picking up a
mitre box for next year.
