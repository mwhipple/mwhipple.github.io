As part of preference for [sustainability](sustainability) and reduced
consumption, I try to repair things rather than jumping to replacing them.

## Broken Ear Bud

I have a pair of

 ear buds which I got at some point several
years ago and have been using them for music while running. One of the ear
hooks just broke off. I'll be trying my standard go-to of Krazy Glue to reattach
it - there shouldn't be much pressure on that part but it is expected to flex
and the material seems to make it somewhat of a crap shoot. If it doesn't take
these will probably be destined for the trash. Given that I'm currently using
my phone and it doesn't have a built-in headphone jack I'll probably swap to
using by Beats headphones if the repair doesn't stick and think about getting
replacements when I'm in shape enough to care about the heavier phones.

The Krazy Glue lasted through one run, but then the hook fell of as I was
removing the bud (it looked like it may have been a different break at the
same point, but I'm unsure). I realized earlier that a better route in any
case given the piece involved and the way it would move would be duck tape.
I have black roll kicking around which somewhat blends in, and so that is the
updated repair approach.
