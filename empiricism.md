- [Up to Home](./)

I'm a strong proponent of
[empiricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-07-23"}.
While I've certainly had a prediliction for a while,
this has been particulaly bolstered in recent times when
misinformation is rife and critical thought seems to be often
foresaken for meme virality.

## In Software

From a Fred Brooks essay I've also more recently come to appreciate the difference
between empiricism and rationalism, where I've seen the latter applied to
effectively squash evolution.

Within the context of computer software there is likely a synergy between empiricism
and
[worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better "Worse is Better - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-07-24}
(whereas The Right Thing tends more towards rationalism), as Worse is Better
lends itself more to pursuing more quantifiable, practical indicators and
earlier surfacing of the relevant data (all of which also fits in with
many [agile](agile) principles.
