# KDE Install

swapping profiles and launching from outset resolved plasma startup...ish
also seemed to require specific invocation including dbus call
profiles and reinstallation (resolved missing akonadi agents)

dbus will be straightened out through sddm

plasma launcher was due to plasma-desktop missing
starting invalid corona "org.kde.plasma.desktop"
