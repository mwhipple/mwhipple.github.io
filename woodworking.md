I'm (optimistically) starting to dabble in
[woodworking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodworking "Woodworking - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-04-01"}.
My family has a decent history
in woodworking including my father from whom I inherited a fair amount of tools,
but my goals for the foreseeable future remain fairly modest and utilitarian.

My first planned project is to build some replacement handles for a Weber
kettle grill where currently I have to use grill gloves at all times.
This seems like a good starting project to mostly just work on my setup,
as the amount there are minimal requirements aside from attaching wood to
act as an insulator in a form that will fit reasonably well and not leave
anyything exposed that could lead to burns. Over time I'd also want to make
sure the handles can decently withstand weather, but for the first iteration I
can just plan on replacing them if that becomes an issue.

I'll also plan on alternating a bit between somewhat canned projects and those
that are more self-directed, allowing each such canned project to hopefully
refine some skills and my workshop setup prior to each project.

To start, I purchased and read
[Beginner's Guide to Starting Woodworking by Lawrence Turner](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y3KD283?ref=yb_qv_ov_kndl_dp_rw "Amazon.com: Beginner's Guide to Starting Woodworking eBook : Turner, Ben: Books"){atime="2024-04-01"}.
It was nice in that it was short...and that's about it. The pictures on the ebook
didn't display but more significantly there was virtually no
insight in the book so it seemed less of an introduction to
the craft and more of an invitation for experimentation to
those who have never made anything from wood before. The content seemed worth a blog post
but did not quite seem worth even the $0.99 USD that was paid.

Creating the grill handle seemed to go fairly well at the
beginning - I used a hand saw to cut two scrap pieces to the desired
length (for the top and bottom), used a chisel to make
indententions to accommodate some tabs on the top, and decided
to first make holes from the bottom up to make sure to align
with the holes in handle, and then put the screws through those
holes from the top down through to the bottom
piece. Unfortunately both pieces of wood ended up getting
horribly split, so at the moment the handle works but it is
likely to fall apart before too long and I'll replace the pieces
either when that happens or when I free up more time. This was
plausibly the result of driving in the screws without first
drilling
[pilot holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_hole "Pilot hole - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-04-28"}
so I'll adapt my practice accordingly.
