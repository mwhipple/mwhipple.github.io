title: Microservices

- [Up to Software Architecture]

I've been involved in a range of microservice pursuits,
going back to when before it was a buzzword.
Not surprisingly the only particularly healthy and productive
such efforts were those that were largely bottom-up and
the resulting microservices were largely emergent rather
than being a goal in and of itself.

Far more often I've witnessed organizations pursue microservices
with at best questionable benefit...and far more likely detriment.
Often the organizations are not equipped to deal with some of the
additional operational challenges nor do they appropriately adjust
the designs; typically such organizations are also unlikely to be
able to subtantiate very vague purported returns on investment as
they don't account for initial increased overhead that would need
to be amortized. Most glaringly, microservices are often viewed as
a somewhat mechanical solution to what are often communication
challenges which rather than resolve those issues tends to make them
far less obvious, deeper into the process/further right, and
often far more costly...they may effectively push issues
that may have surfaced at buld time to manifest at run time.

I fairly recently reference Adrian Cockroft after attending one
of his talks shortly after he left Netflix. In a
[more recent interview](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/microservices-netflix-industry "Microservices Retrospective – What We Learned (and Didn’t Learn) from Netflix - InfoQ"){atime="2024-09-07"}
he also touches on what I've also been discovering lately
in that many of the fairly early problems remain underserved.
I've been repeatedly coming across generic concerns that I worked
through many years ago and expect there to be readily usable, mature
solutions but instead find that many of them feel as though they
haven't moved or are only now catching up. While we've adopted
increasingly sophisticated platforms upon which we run our applications,
the last mile to value delivery still seems as long as ever;
it seems as though there may be somewhat of a competition between
taming the sophisticated technical aspects and delivering on
user requirements.

I certainly recognize that many of these tools enable functionality
that may otherwise be unfeasible for many companies, but I'd also
posit that most companies don't need that functionality and few would
be able to realize net value in their adoption (probably along
the Pareto lines of the 20% of organizations that provide the 80% of
impact).
