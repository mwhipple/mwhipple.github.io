Requirements engineering is practice which is widely neglected and my interest in it was particularly
piqued after working for a few companies that suffered from related issues and then attending a talk
by Bertrand Meyer on the "PEGS" of requirements engineering.

Unfortunately misuse of Agile has unfortunately enabled the perspective that requirements are unnecessary.
This is largely inconsistent with the core presmise of Agile being to prioritize value delivery and
the tenuous prospect of being able to validate value porposition without requirements let alone some
of the additional pursuits such as negotiable satisfaction of stories all of which becomes increasingly
rigid if there's a widening chasm between what is built and ultimate proposed value. This particular
concern is also a result of concerns with modeling (along with pursuits such as Domain-Driven Design
which will likely be discussed separately along with its relationship with Agile and prospective
hijacking of the concept.

From a verification perspective lack of requirements is also very problematic. I've worked for several
companies that adopted a stance that the current behavior of the system is the way that it should behave
but such a perpsective is incredibly limiting in that a system that is specified in terms of itself cannot
be safely changed...or perhaps more accurately _any_ change is putatively safe since any newly introduced
issues would just be blindly incorporated into the imaginary specification. Such a perspective makes larger
scale changes virtually impossible, as are managing concerns such as forward and backward compatibility and
avoiding lockstep deployments. Not surprisingly those companies that had this perpsective were also mired
in states in which changes were difficult and dangerous and complexity and bloat accreted unchecked.
Typically in such organizations I end up starting the long-haul of retroactively building out executable
specifications.

One of my most frequently referenced resources for requirements engineering is
<a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~chengb/RE-491/Papers/dark-corners-re-zave-jackson.pdf"
   title="Four Dark Corners of Requirements Engineering"

On the most basic level this is a useful reference to dissuade implementation bias which
seems fairly endemic particularly when engineers specify their systems, and provides a helpful
perspective in terms of machine and environment which speaks to the underlying desire to be able to
validate rather than just verify. This also provides additional tools in terms of delineating formal
definitions and informal designations and using the latter to trace things back to impacts on the
environment (along with other approaches to track how things fit together). While formal definitions
are unlikely to be palatable in most organizations, having a precise glossary/ubiquitous language is
massive enabler for shared understanding and the assorted approaches to both delineate and connect
the environment and machine through language are very useful to preserve the ability to validate
systems.
