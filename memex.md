[Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex "Memex - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-03-29"}
is a provisional name I'm giving to my overall approach to organizing
information, based on the idea by Vannevar Bush as published in
[As We May Think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think "As We May Think - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-03-30"}
(viewable from
[ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/227181.227186 "As we may think - 227181.227186.pdf"){atime="2024-04-26"}
among other places) which has been similarly borrowed many times. The
term may be swapped if it is determined it is not particularly suitable
or invites too much confusion, I've alternatively called it my
[grimoire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimoire "Grimoire - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-03-29"}
(to swap from one nerdy idea to another).

The underlying pursuit is that of collecting and composing concepts,
which is certainly not a novel nor innovative pursuit. This has been an
effort that has passed through several incarnations over the years but
is potentially somewhat sharpened by the recent emergence of viable
generative AI. This amounts to the pursuit of a
[linked data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data "Linked data - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-03-29"}
style network of trustworthy (i.e. falsifiable/empirical/authoritative)
information alongside constructions of such information. Over time the
different means to
[represent the underlying knowledge graph](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2023/11/finding-answers-about-the-best-way-to-find-answers/ "Finding Answers (About the Best Way to Find Answers) - USC Viterbi | School of Engineering"){atime="2024-08-29"}
will also be explored.

Again, this is not anything new but the overall effort seems to
consistently run up against biases that push things away from those
goals except in fields in which they are enforced. Practical information
tends to fall into silos as pieces of it are carved off and contorted
into new contexts after which it is more subject to reproduction and
dilution through cargo culting, and likely due to a human bias towards
certainty concepts tend to get subsumed by specifics, leading to
unnecessarily repeated attention on questions of how rather than what
(certainly worth asking\...but often not repeating).

This is also pretty emphatically aspirational, this has not yet led
anywhere for me and there\'s not much of a reason to think that it will.

In terms of \"concepts\" this is focused on seeking solutions which are
portable and mostly declarative, without getting tangled up with
underlying engines. That specific term was adopted after having attended
a talk by
[Daniel Jackson](https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/daniel-jackson-on-the-essence-of-software "Daniel Jackson on The Essence of Software | Princeton University Press"){atime="2024-03-30"}.
I\'ve not yet read his book but based on the talk his use of concept
seemed to distill several overlapping ideas into a framework that cuts
across software, cognition, and reality.

This is also driven by an underlying goal of insulating abstract models
from particular representations. This seems very much in line with the
foundations of software engineering in that it rests on top of many
layers of abstraction where perhaps the most prominent boundary is that
software is written without knowledge of the circuits that underlie most
modern computers which has allowed the field to progress from earlier
types of machines (such as from vacuum to solid state) and to expand to
other variations such as quantum and biological. This is not to dismiss
those cases where higher levels of
[mechanical sympathy](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.mechanical-sympathy.en.html "Mechanical Sympathy - AWS Well-Architected Framework"){atime="2024-03-29"}
are valuable, but to posit that there is more value in abstraction.
Unfortunately software in practice tends to also lean in the opposite
direction where too much focus on details of representation of logic and
data introduces levels of Balkanization and corresponding inefficiency.
To some extent this is the nature of the beast as programming is largely
the practice of realizing abstractions in precise, computable forms
which naturally requires selection of such forms, but preserving the
notion that all such forms are incidental can ensure that they are
treated as such and attention remains more properly focused on the
essence.

My means of concept curation are fairly slow and therefore this is also
complemented by a [toolbox](toolbox) which consists of tools that are
ultimately compositions of concepts, but which are applied as larger,
potentially more opaque, chunks. All together this provides a mix of
more bottom up concept curation and top down tool dissection.
