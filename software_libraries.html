	 title="GitHub - dtolnay/anyhow: Flexible concrete Error type built on std::error::Error"
	 data-atime="2025-04-13">anyhow</a> seems fairly heavily used throughout Rust projects.
      It was one of the first libraries I came across while starting to work with Rust in earnest
      (through working on gstreamer). The code is nice and clean with well-documented key files,
      and the project overall seems like a nice demonstration of how to implement a compatibility
      layer in Rust. For narrow uses it seems as though making use of the standard Error trait
      may be sufficient, but this certainly seems like a valuable tool for building maintainable,
      portable software which is likely a core aspect of the Rust
      model when compared to providing or expecting a broad standard library (which is something I'd
      want to find or write a description of at some point).
