available image, I start with the Dockerfile and identify any necessary
supporting work from there. This may be more of a top-down approach given that
it may operate on resources such as configuration files that may not exist, but
often such files may not be necessary if the container can be provided the
necessary information through environment variables, command arguments,
or mounting external files (all of which can keep the image more focused and
generalized).
