title: Comment

A Comment is text which is intended for readers of source but which is
ignored by the compiler. The underlying mechanism of being able to ignore
and typically remove comments was important when resources where at a
premium, but in modern systems it may be more valuable for commentary
to be understood and optionally preserved as code metadata.

Comments tend to exist in either a line-oriented form
(where a comment marker indicates the rest of the current line
is a comment and therefore the end-of-line provides an
implicit terminator) or block form which makes use of
an explicit terminator (and can therefore span multiple
lines or also be succeeded by code on the same line.
