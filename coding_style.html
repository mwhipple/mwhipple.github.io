<p>
I strive to mostly adopt practices which are idiomatic for particularly
programming languages, but I also have preferences which cut across
languages.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org475b0e4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org475b0e4"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Literate Programming and Commenting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Likely my most obvious tendency is that I am a proponent of some form
of Literate Programming. This manifests as large blocks of comments
which outline what the subsequent blocks of code are doing. The
comments themselves will consist of complete sentences. Unless there
are other conventions (such as with Go), such sentences are likely to
be in the imperative mood as that lends itself to the tersest form of
complete sentence within the surrounding context.
</p>

<p>
This conflicts with the fantasy of "self-documenting code" which will
be argued against separately <span class="underline">but</span> this should not be construed as an
alternative to expressive code. The code itself should express what it
doing with reasonable clarity and the comments should serve to
contextualize what is defined and to capture supporting information
such as factors driving particular decisions.
</p>

<p>
Such comments are likely to be redundant with the implementation but
this is not deemed to be an issue. The English version should
hopefully be easier to read and repetition is likely to be beneficial
given the challenge of reading code and understanding a system. There
may be the assertion that such duplication invites confusing
divergence but I find any assertion that this should dissuade the
practice to be lacking. In my experience those code bases which are
most inscrutable are those that are largely devoid of comments and any
claim that fostering practices that pay attention to both code and its
comments would lead to inconsistency seems dubious. That being said,
the comments should not be trusted implicitly and in that vein the
comments and the code should be treated as complementary channels
whose readings reinforce each other rather than one supplanting the
other (both of which can be further supported through additional
information which may be external or stored elsewhere such as VCS
logs). An argument of being led astray by poor documentation when
code is available (as hopefully are tests) is a reflection of the
wrong kind of laziness around understanding the system and carries the
implicit assertion that somehow the correct behavior would have been
inferred without the distraction whereas attention should yield the
realization that documentation is incorrect but potentially still
elucidating some of the steps along the history of the system whereas
a void is likely to just leave mystery.  In the words of Dick Brandon
"Documentation is like sex: when it is good, it is very, very good;
and when it is bad, it is better than nothing."
</p>

<p>
Very often the comment blocks will be followed by a blank space. This
is a practice that was picked up for portability - I believe both from
some basic tanlging utility that I'd written and also for ReST.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org64cef33" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org64cef33"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Comment Block Style</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
I now tend to write fairly narrative comment blocks with conventions
to indicate information such as what the parameters are. For quite a
while I tried to follow a more structured format with my reference
baseline (for reasons of portability) being Doxygen, but the
combination of Literate Programming, Go conventions, and the constant
battle to make such information meaningful and not painfully redundant
led me away from that form. In many languages such structures are
unlikely to provide any additional information from what is expressed
directly in the code, so avoiding that approach can hopefully
encourage complementary information that is not swamped by redundant
boilerplate.

<div id="outline-container-orgd19a78a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd19a78a"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Chekhov's Gun and Understandability</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
I tend to differentiate between code that is <b>readable</b> and that
which is <b>understandable</b> (the suitability of the terms themselves
warrants deeper vetting). One of the more insidious challenges when
writing software is the siren song of confirmation bias - it is very
easy to get seduced by code that may suggest and seem to do what is
desired but may in fact be slightly but significantly askew. The code
may be telling you the story you want to hear but acting on a slightly
different variation. To some extent this also reinforces the previous
point around commenting in that there could easily be three sides to
this story: what you want the code to do, what you expect the code to
do, and what the code actually does. The last two of course <b>should</b>
match but it may be wise to embrace that as an ongoing effort rather
than expecting it to be realized out of the gate.
</p>

<p>
That challenge is where the goal of <b>understandability</b> comes in.
A common risk with <b>readable</b> code (in addition to it being deceptive)
is that what is desired is a subset of what the code could do, and
therefore there is a corresponding implicit expectation that the code
will only be used in certain ways and only certain paths through it
will be utilized. Such dangers arise not only when code is written,
but also as it changes over time which can easily inject entropy as
loose fitting pieces may be used in unplanned and inconsistent
ways. In such cases the code may be <b>readable</b> in that it is telling
you a relevant story but it may not be <b>understandable</b> in that the
entirety of the what the code may be doing is not surfaced. Such a gap
may be standard and acceptable as a user of a system, but as a
maintainer or owner of such a system it is a recipe for trouble, and
depending on the system such trouble could be disastrous.
</p>

<p>
A means to counter such issues is to avoid paths and constructs which
are unnecessary. This extends beyond the typical avoidance of dead
code to include practices such as (cyclomatic) simplicity (which
will be covered later), restricting usable paths, and
avoidance of distracting assignments/statements/lvalues.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6609538" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org6609538"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Restricting Unnecessary Paths</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
One means to prevent code behaving in unexpected ways is to
guard against any paths which are not anticipated to be used. More
ideal is to design out any such paths which will be discussed further
in the simplicity section, but sometimes such an approach is not
visible or feasible. The logic should eagerly protect against cases
which are not anticipated. This guidance is effectively defensive
programming with the follow-up advice to make sure that any such cases
are not simply handled but contained. Any urge to support cases
outside of those that are necessary should be resisted if they
increase the complexity of the system as a whole. Such guards may
include signaling some kind of error or (where appropriate) returning
some form of zero or limited value. Restricting such paths is
enormously valuable to reduce the overall system complexity
particularly in light of the impacts that may ripple from more naive
or half-baked measures.
</p>

<p>
An extension of this idea that is not directly related to my style but
is an element in the backing philosophy is to negotiate requirements
based on the incurred complexity (and concomitant risk). There is
often a long tail of possible functionality with varying accompanying
levels of speculation and imposed overhead in both development and
maintenance. There can be a temptation to pursue a complete solution,
but supporting any such behaviors should be subjected to some form of
cost/benefit analysis particularly in terms of likely impacts on the
evolvability of the system. This echoes a talk by Greg Young (to link)
and likely others.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8cb386b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8cb386b"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Avoidance of Unnecessary Statements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
The avoidance of unnecessary statements may seemingly conflict directly
with a practice often used in the name of making code more readable -
using assignment as a means to provide a more meaningful identifier
for a given value. Such lvalues however also imply that the values may
be accessed multiple times, and in cases where this is not the case
the assignments can be misleading and direct use of the
expression/rvalue when relevant not only avoids that implication but
also directly associates the value with its point of use. This mirrors
the dramatic principle of Chekhov's Gun where anything that is implied
by given code should be realized and if it is not realized any such
implication should be avoided.
</p>

<p>
Unnecessary identifiers increase the cognitive overhead in
understanding a block of code in that they introduce additional items
which needs to be mentally tracked. This can be pernicious
as code evolves (and the number of references may shift) particularly
when mutability is in play (which can massively increase the cognitive
load for tracking sequencing and control flow). All too often the use
of such assignments can be counter-productive in that they are
band-aids on sprawling function bodies with many such identifiers with
relatively ambiguous names (which then magnifies the mentioned
headaches as the code changes).
</p>

<p>
As a counterpoint, I do tend to make use of such identifiers in more
expression based contexts that serve to both improve legibility and
narrow the scope and life of the introduced identifier. This typically
takes the form of something analogous to a function where the name of
the function and parameters may be more descriptive but the restricted
binding environment serves to provide a self-contained chunk rather
than polluting a larger context.
</p>

<p>
I therefore prefer code which remains focused on a particular task and
does not include any constructs which are unnecessary for that
task. This can result in relatively dense code but the focus should
result in easily digestible chunks and the corresponding comments
should provide the context to understand and verify the code.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb6a015e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb6a015e"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Simplicity and Composability</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
As touch on several times above I strive to keep code <b>cyclomatically</b>
simple which is a (potentially incorrect) way of saying that branching
is avoided. There are three employed mechanisms that spring to mind to
aid in this goal (some of the names may need further attention):
polymorphism, composition, and narrow design.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org136b445" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org136b445"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> Polymorphism</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
Polymorphism is one of the most evangelized means to
reduce branching. I will therefore avoid parroting information that is
readily available elsewhere around avoiding if statements. In the
interest of being concise this can be extended to include the range of
strategies that allow dispatching to any particular implementation of
an interface which may extend to additional behaviors such as
overloading with various forms of dispatching and multimethods.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orged195fd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orged195fd"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> Composition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
By composition here I'm referring to composition of subroutine calls
rather than composition of objects (over inheritance&#x2026;which is also
good advice and may be covered in a larger thread around OOP). When
looking toward reuse of code there are two common approaches: either
create relatively centralized functions which perform a range of
behavior or call out to other functions or build out a catalog of
relatively simpler functions which can then be composed in different
ways to cover the range of needs. The former is often gravitated
towards which unfortunately produces systems which tend to be more
complex and more difficult and more dangerous to change. Such pieces
of code tend to become centralized and the mentioned drawbacks tend to
compound over time. The alternative is to make use of individual
smaller functions, composing them as need while keeping the
invocations focused on specific behavior rather than trying to push
what may be multiple behaviors through a single function.
</p>

<p>
In the most glaring cases such centralized code involves the client
passing arguments which indicate a desired variation but are passed
through a single function which is expected to coordinate all such
variations. There is no evident benefit to such an approach when
compared to having the calling code invoke multiple simpler methods as
anything along the lines of decoupling is destroyed by the
expectations attached to the arguments, but there are severe drawbacks
in terms of complexity, flexibility, and maintainability. 
</p>

<p>
The end result resembles an hourglass which is an image I've used in
the past to describe it but have recently learned about the Hourglass
Theorem in respect to the reduced cost of providing a narrow waist
upon which a wide range of upper bells can rest. Perhaps more
appropriate is something along the lines of an <code>X</code> as a distinguishing
property from the hourglass of the theorem is that there's a
correspondence of the rays on one side or the other, so perhaps a
better image is that of a yarn doll where a given thread continues but
is contorted through choke points such that it becomes difficult to
follow or change.
</p>

<p>
It should also be noted that this is very much focused on code that
does <b>different</b> things and therefore does not conflict with the
previous section around polymorphism nor supporting constructs such as
registries and routers that can aid in abstraction and decoupling and
perhaps most significantly do not pose the risk of rigidity and bloat
described herein.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7341a90" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7341a90"><span class="section-number-3">4.3.</span> Narrow Design</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
"Narrow design" is certainly the most quickly contrived name of those
attached to these practices; it is being used to describe the practice
of designing systems such that they are structured to only provide
intended behaviors.. This may <b>seem</b> as though it is a given, but all
too often such structural alignment does not exist and additional
constraints are added by logic. This often manifests in APIs which may
be modeled as relatively flat operations and objects where particular
calls or combinations of parameters may be invalid. Where
opportunities exist to model the API more richly such that it maps
more directly to operations that are supported the resulting local
logic can be significantly reduced and the experience for clients is
likely to improve given the resultant natural expressiveness of the
interface (where typically the flatter structure would require picking
through textual descriptions).
</p>

<p>
In terms of defining objects/structs this ties in with larger goals
around guaranteeing such objects are sound, and preferring practices
such as sum types over product types when the latter could contain
properties that may be spurious and expected to be ignored based on
the state of a particular instance.
</p>

<p>
In all such cases the underlying goal is to leverage the mechanisms
that are already in place to prevent invalid states or paths from
coming into existence and therefore avoiding the need for custom logic
to detect and deal with such states.
</p>

<p>
There <b>may</b> be thoughts that a flatter approach may lend itself to
more rapid extension in that validation rules could simply be
relaxed. A clear counter-argument to the above is that it is typically
much easier to safely evolve pieces that are more focused and
independent. This is particularly the case in APIs where more focused
endpoints more clearly convey intent and therefore provide some more
protection from Hyrum's Law and also contain the friction that may
arise when trying to shift how a given call is handled. This is a
manifestation of many of the points covered in the previous
Composition section.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
There are some good quotes to drop in this section, certainly
Don Knuth's "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" is
relevant along with one by Grace Hopper around the importance of
moving to more declarative programming. There's also a lot of more
recent articles related to the limitations of serial and RAM model
development which largely presumes largely homogeneous architectures
pushed along by Moore's Law.
</p>

<p>
Knuth's quote is particularly poignant given that it was originally
presented in a paper that predates but discusses concepts that exist
within optimizing compilers, and the overall sentiment is one that
I've come across in numerous places including being touched upon by
Jeffrey Ullman in his Turing Award talk with Alfred Aho and is also
covered by <a href="sources.html#ddia">Martin Kleppmann</a> in regards to SQL and how optimization of
declarative languages wins in the long run.

Code should focus as much as possible on <b>what</b> is being done rather
than seeking to micromanage <b>how</b> it is done for the sake of
optimization. The definition and use of declarative constructs should
be relied upon as much as possible and as necessary means to optimize
how they are executed should be performed by a distinct phase which is
more aware of the runtime.
</p>

<p>
My code will therefore make liberal use of practices that are intended
to make code more declarative or economical but that may incur
performance penalties. A straightforward example would be calls to
subroutines. If performance issues are noticed and profiling suggests
that code should be optimized then such optimization should seek to
preserve the above goal or if pragmatically it cannot then it should
be accompanied by assessing how any used optimizers may be improved.
