I'll be collecting information for this site <span class="underline">primarily</span> through
navigation rather than searching. This is partly for amusement and
also to foster deeper knowledge acquisition. I will likely at some
point also look at producing a visualization of the resulting graph
using something DOTy.
</p>

<p>
One of the initial roots for the search will be Martin Kleppmann's
excellent <a href="sources.html#ddia">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> which is not only a
great resource by itself but also a treasure trove of <a href="sources.html#ddia-references">useful
references</a>. In addition to this I'll be using books that I have or
discover at libraries and information read from assorted memberships
to O'Reilly, ACM, IEEE and the New York Times.
</p>

<p>
Additionally this will be supplemented by research done in support of
particular projects, where the paths to connect any such detached
pieces of information will be sought over time.

Initially the source for this site will be hosted on GitHub. I
personally have more interest in some other alternatives which I'll

I'm currently using for work and also is the most readily navigable
service from my Information Collection approach, starting with some
GitHub blog posts.

<h2 id="org273f15f"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Google App Engine</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
<a href="sources.html#gae">Google App Engine</a> is a viable hosting option that came up fairly
early in my information navigation and seems to potentially fit the
right set of criteria. Google Cloud is also a technology I'll be using
for work and one which I haven't spent too much time (like much of the
industry I'm far more comfortable with AWS).
</p>

<p>
I used and evangelized GAE a fair amount quite a while ago (prior to
and during the period when it went General Availability), and would be
likely to use it again if I were looking to develop an appropriate
app. While I'm currently looking to use the flexible model for
containerized deployment I've generally been of the mindset that
adapting designs to fit within the constraints of systems like GAE can
provide significant upfront benefits. Typically the aversion to such
technologies that I've seen seems to be a fixed mindset where people
are turned off that they can't use their preferred hammers, which
isn't to say that that isn't often a compelling reason, particularly
for an organization. Similarly there may be some cases for which a
particular type of technology is most appropriate but an awkward
fit. Additionally I haven't run the numbers for GAE in particular but
in most similar systems there's a breakeven point after which it is
likely to be far more cost effective to use something closer to the
metal even after accounting for the operational overhead. But&#x2026;as
mentioned the <span class="underline">upfront</span> benefits can be substantial and other than
cultural resistance (which isn't a concern for my personal projects)
many of the other concerns are initially aspirational.
</p>

<p>
For this particular project I'll be looking to make use of the
<a href="sources.html#gae-flexible">flexible environment</a> as I'm very comfortable with dealing with
containers and I'll be starting to use a non-supported runtime and
likely evolving into making use of a relatively standard container
which is also not directly supported, so in both cases relying on a
<a href="sources.html#gae-custom">custom runtime</a>. An enticing longer term plan may be to switch to <a href="sources.html#src-gae-cloud-run">Cloud
Run</a> as it is likely to be lower cost at low volume, but in the
immediate term it seems like a distraction and I may also want to look
at more static-centric alternatives in the future.

<h2 id="org5c515c3"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> nginx</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
I'll be looking to deploy this site as a static site hosted through
nginx as outlined in the Google App Engine flexible runtime
<a href="sources.html#src-gae-quickstart">quickstart</a>. I've spent a fair amount of time fiddling with nginx and
while I'm not particularly fond of their business model (particularly
the somewhat crippled open source offering) the software itself has
proven to be very robust and efficient with wide adoption&#x2026;and I have
assorted nginx stickers and T-shirts (one of which is black-on-black
and probably my favorite tech shirt) so I should probably validate the
swag by using the software. My past experience also gives me
confidence that I can bend it to my wishes in some way or another and
maybe learn some new tricks along the way (I already have a module
sitting around to address the DNS resolution issue which may otherwise
dissuade me).

<div id="outline-container-org35b961a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org35b961a"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> Artanis (Old)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
This site was going to will looking to be running on top of <a href="sources.html#src-gnuartanis">GNU
Artanis</a>. This is largely a consequence of the approach to
Information Collection, although the project may potentially align
with some longer term goals. I'm more likely to ultimately land on a
solution that is more closely aligned with a static Web site/JAM
stack, but I think I also want the site to have some basic support for
concepts such as content negotiation which many static solutions don't
lend themselves naturally to and therefore I'll probably ultimately
move to something like nginx (which is also recommended in front of
Artanis but I haven't navigated my way over there yet). I enjoy Scheme
but am likely to gravitate more towards Python, I'll elaborate upon
some of my larger thoughts around languages in an upcoming update.
</p>

<p>
Relatively up-to-date information on Artanis seems to be provided on
its <a href="sources.html#src-artanis_github">GitLab page</a> (including containerized execution which I'll be
looking to build on top of). Artanis itself is built on top of <a href="sources.html#src-gnuguile">GNU
Guile</a> which was installed but not detected on my system (it is
potentially outdated), so I may also dig into that project though I'll
likely start with seeing about containerized Artanis.

<div id="outline-container-org7dfe99a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7dfe99a"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Containerized Execution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
I'll be looking to run Artanis in a container, and accordingly the
initially desired development environment is also using containers to
most closely align with the deployment (installing anything on my host
is effectively more of a workflow optimization). There are <a href="sources.html#src-nalaginrut-artanis-docker">some
instructions</a> provided for running Artanis in a container, but those
instructions need to be tuned a bit. Most significantly the tag for
the image is outdated and should instead be more of the form
`registry.gitlab.com/hardenedlinux/artanis` to reflect the project
being transferred. Updated guidance is provided with the <a href="sources.html#src-nalaginrut-artanis_0.5_docker">instructions
for Artanis 0.5</a>. Beyond that there are a few adjustments for the
sake of usability and reproducibility: the image should have an
appropriate entrypoint so that it can be launched directly and an
ostensibly immutable tag should be used (where the latter concern
transcends the scope of the blog post). The entrypoint decision is
somewhat a matter of preference or perspective where the instructions
seem to be more oriented towards using the container to provide an
interactive contained environment which takes care of dependencies
whereas my preference would be more of a directly invokable utility
container which is more targeted towards providing a service to the
host (where the entrypoint can always be overridden if needed). I'll
therefore likely create an image for local development which adjusts
the entrypoint whereas I'd typically look to just use the upstream
image for that purpose (along with expected tweaks to the command.
There's also a decent chance the image could be slimmed down a bit if
it's not expected to be interactive, but it doesn't seem <span class="underline">overly</span>
large given the use case and so that feels like premature optimization
for the time being (it seems unnecessarily large given the
functionality for a deployment that is expected to scale but I
presently have no reason to think this site fits that criterion).  The
standard upstream image also seems to fall into a fairly common trap
of using root rather than a less-privileged user. I think this is
covered as part of Dockerfile best practices that I'll need to chase
down.  Another fairly general note is that the guidance on the post
suggests using <a href="sources.html#src-docker-get">docker</a> but I'd probably gravitate towards an
alternative like `nerdctl`. This is relatively insignificant as it can
be abstracted by the Makefile but seems worth mentioning given the
strong sentiment in the Artanis documentation and the GNU community as
a whole towards free software against which the licensing for Docker
Desktop <span class="underline">may</span> run afoul.
