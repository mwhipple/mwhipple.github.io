I'll be collecting information for this site <span class="underline">primarily</span> through
navigation rather than searching. This is partly for amusement and
also to foster deeper knowledge acquisition. I will likely at some
point also look at producing a visualization of the resulting graph
using something DOTy.
</p>

<p>
One of the initial roots for the search will be Martin Kleppmann's
excellent <a href="sources.html#ddia">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> which is not only a
great resource by itself but also a treasure trove of <a href="sources.html#ddia-references">useful
references</a>. In addition to this I'll be using books that I have or
discover at libraries and information read from assorted memberships
to O'Reilly, ACM, IEEE and the New York Times.
</p>

<p>
Additionally this will be supplemented by research done in support of
particular projects, where the paths to connect any such detached
pieces of information will be sought over time.

Initially the source for this site will be hosted on GitHub. I
personally have more interest in some other alternatives which I'll

I'm currently using for work and also is the most readily navigable
service from my Information Collection approach, starting with some
GitHub blog posts.

<h2 id="org731126c"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Google App Engine</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
<a href="sources.html#gae">Google App Engine</a> is a viable hosting option that came up fairly
early in my information navigation and seems to potentially fit the
right set of criteria. Google Cloud is also a technology I'll be using
for work and one which I haven't spent too much time (like much of the
industry I'm far more comfortable with AWS).
</p>

<p>
I used and evangelized GAE a fair amount quite a while ago (prior to
and during the period when it went General Availability), and would be
likely to use it again if I were looking to develop an appropriate
app. While I'm currently looking to use the flexible model for
containerized deployment I've generally been of the mindset that
adapting designs to fit within the constraints of systems like GAE can
provide significant upfront benefits. Often such technologies seem to
turn people off as they preclude use or preferred hammers (which may
or may not be a valid reason particularly within an organization).
Similarly there may be some cases for which a particular type of
technology is most appropriate but an awkward fit. Additionally I
haven't run the numbers for GAE in particular but in most similar
systems there's a break-even point after which it is likely to be far
more cost effective to use something closer to the metal even after
accounting for the operational overhead. But&#x2026;as mentioned the
<span class="underline">upfront</span> benefits can be substantial and other than cultural
resistance (which isn't a concern for my personal projects) many of
the other concerns are initially aspirational.
</p>

<p>
For this particular project I'll be looking to make use of the
<a href="sources.html#gae-flexible">flexible environment</a> as I'm very comfortable with dealing with
containers and I'll be starting to use a non-supported runtime.
This is likely to evolve into making use of a relatively standard container
which is also not directly supported, so in both cases I'll be relying on a
<a href="sources.html#gae-custom">custom runtime</a>. An enticing longer term plan may be to switch to <a href="sources.html#gae-cloud-run">Cloud
Run</a> as it is likely to be lower cost at low volume, but in the
immediate term it seems like a distraction and I may also want to look
at more static alternatives in the future.
</p>

<p>
I'm also coincidentally looking at Cloud Run for a work related
project so that seems likely to slide it in place sooner.

<div id="outline-container-org0908e9f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0908e9f"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> nginx</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
I'll be looking to deploy this site as a static site hosted through
<a href="sources.html#nginx-oss">nginx (open source)</a> as outlined in the Google App Engine custom runtime
<a href="sources.html#gae-custom-quickstart">quickstart</a>. I've spent a fair amount of time fiddling with nginx and
while I'm not particularly fond of their business model (particularly
the somewhat crippled open source offering) the software itself has
proven to be very robust and efficient with wide adoption&#x2026;and I have
assorted <a href="sources.html#nginx">nginx</a> stickers and T-shirts (one of which is black-on-black
and probably my favorite tech shirt) so I should probably validate the
swag by using the software. My past experience also gives me
confidence that I can bend it to my wishes in some way or another and
maybe learn some new tricks along the way (I already have a module
sitting around to address the DNS resolution issue which may otherwise
dissuade me).

<div id="outline-container-org8e19629" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8e19629"><span class="section-number-3">6.1.</span> Dockerfile</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
Certainly one of the most standard dependencies for a containerized
deployment is defining or producing what image is used. In this case
I'll be using a Dockerfile for that since it was what is documented in
the quick start, and it's currently my preferred approach. The preference
is largely out of familiarity - I'm also intrigued by buildpacks, especially
given their pursued reproducibility, but the current lack of official support
for <code>arm64</code>  dissuades me from making the switch (my work computers
are typically Apple silicon though my personal systems tend to remain <code>amd64</code>).
</p>

<p>
In a scenario such as this one where I'd be looking to make use of an already
available image, I start with the Dockerfile and identify any necessary
supporting work from there. This may be more of a top-down approach given that
it may operate on resources such as configuration files that may not exist, but
often such files may not be necessary if the container can be provided the
necessary information through environment variables, command arguments,
or mounting external files (all of which can keep the image more focused and
generalized).
