      <h1>Computer Security - Matt Whipple</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Computer security is not something that I've been
    particularly drawn to, but is something that seems to keep
    falling into my lap. Creating secure systems is a
    responsibility shared by all engineers but I also tended to be
    involved in the foundational and organization-wide solutions as
    an engineer, and in my current architectural role security is
    constant consideration. While I've tended to intermittently
    look in to security concerns I'm recently seeking to maintain a
    decent level of expertise given that it has recurred so
    frequently throughout my career.</p>
    <p>While most companies now recognize the importance of
    security and are likely to establish commensurate practices, in
    my estimation many such efforts are likely to be either
    ineffective due to attempting to blindly overlay policies or
    technologies without appropriate means for validation which may
    translate to little more than <a href=

    "Security theater - Wikipedia" data-atime="2024-06-04">security
    theater</a> ...or worse they can counter-productive through
    effectively restricting the application of more stringent
    controls. The former concern will be a a recurring theme and
    will therefore be left alone for now, but the latter is worth a
    brief speaking to. Often access to manage controls themselves
    are restricted to a small set of operators and tools but the
    ability to modify such controls is a crucial enabler for
    granting <a href=

    title="Principle of least privilege - Wikipedia" data-atime=

    inhibit such flexible configuration (likely instead offering
    coarser canned options) then it both undermines that principle
    and is also likely a symptom of larger issues that may reflect
    a false sense of security. This particular type of issue is
    better addressed through an automated (continuous delivery)
    workflow which preserves the flexibility without slowing
    feedback cycles in lower environments nor overloading
    infrastructure teams while still allowing for oversight and
    restricted access to production environments</p>

    "2024-06-04">Bruce Schneier</a> has been passing across my
    radar very often recently (before I resolved (and was assigned)
    digging more into security) and so I'll start working my way
    through some of his material. I find it somewhat interesting
    that Inrupt is not listed on his Wikipedia page but since I've
    not yet gotten around to contributing to Wikipedia I'll just
    note that here.</p>
