title: Agile
---

As I'd guess most software professionals have been, I've been
subjected to range of Agile practices, where I tend to use the capital
"A" in relation to some of the packaged frameworks and the lower case
"agile" to represent the property which those frameworks are
purportedly trying to enable.

I've overall been fortunate in that I've only been subjected to an
invasion of consultants once, and have otherwise been in a position
where I have been able to establish pragmatic and healthy working
contracts.

Overall I tend to think that the ideas underlying Agile are sound and
have a solid background (a history that is often ignored), but more
often than not the ideas seem to get abused (especially when dressed up
as simple solutions to complex problems) and concepts from the
[agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org "Manifesto for Agile Software Development"){atime="2024-05-17"}
seemingly get
[cherry picked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking "Cherry picking - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-06-03"}
even though it seems short enough that no content should be ignored
lightly.
