    <h1>Programming Languages</h1>

    <p>
      Over the years I've worked with a wide range of programming
      languages professionally or for the sake of
      curiosity/enrichment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A distinction which often seems neglected by practitioners is
      that between application programming and systems
      programming. The boundary between the two can sometimes get
      muddy, but I find the distinction crucial in that from my
      perspective application programming should remain very focused
      on delivery of novel value where the details of the underlying
      system represent excessive accidental complexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For application programming I tend to view programming languages
      as given out-sized attention to the point where they are often
      harmful - sometimes breeding fetishistic preferences and
      generally introducing waste associated with bridging different
      means of expressing "how" (which is the nature of languages)
      isomorphic "what"s are represented, none of which translates to
      the environmental impacts which are the net value of the
      produced machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      My practical approach to try to avoid some of this waste is to
      adopt something like Lisp as my preferred application programming language. I'd
      been considering different options for a bit and was generally
      strongly drawn to a language that offered some level of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity"
	 title="Homoiconicity - Wikipedia"
	 data-atime="2024-04-06">homoiconicity</a>
      (for basic desires such as more natural encoding of data structures
      and declarative interfaces rather than more sophisticated
      meta-programming) when I stumbled in to watching Rich Hickey's
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4"
	 title="'Simple Made Easy' - Rich Hickey (2011) - YouTube"
	 data-atime="2024-04-04">Simple Made Easy</a>
      talk which somewhat sealed the deal. I first acquired a fondness
      for Lisp due to SICP (like many others) but more popular languages like
      Python promised many of the same benefits (Python and some other
      languages could be treated as sitting on top of dictionaries or
      objects rather than lists), but the richer syntax of such
      languages raises corresponding complexity.
      Stopping caring about syntax leads naturally to wanting a language for which parsing
      is particularly easy, and Lisp is a language which not only has
      flavors across many, many runtimes but for which parsing can
      typically be thrown together with minimal effort. Specifically
      I'll be looking to make use of a portable subset of Scheme as
      Scheme pursues a small number of primitives which maps
      naturally to the prospect of implementing such primitives
      wherever necessary and leveraging the complementary simple means
      of combination and abstraction common to Lisps (with the option of
      tabling some of the more sophisticated metasyntactic
      extensibility). This aligns with a big picture desire to be able to
      approach application programming by seeking to adopt composable
      computational constructs which can be floated on top of
      abstracted systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently exploring the idea of largely using a combination
      of lisp and YAML, resulting in the equivalent of the ability to
      embed sexps inside of YAML documents.
      <a href="https://github.com/yaml/yamlscript"
	 title="GitHub - yaml/yamlscript: Programming in YAML"
	 data-atime"2024-04-13">YAMLScript</a>
      seems to be exploring a similar space but I'd be looking to make
      use of a different format where rather than relying upon a
      special marker (an extra colon) within the entry definition, I'd
      be looking to have the trigger for evaluation be the typical use
      of parentheses around the expression - thereby falling back to
      the behavior where such values would be parsed as strings and
      could therefore have latent expansion applied. This also
      potentially feels comparable to the distinction between LISP-1s
      and LISP-2s where keeping the evaluation in the expression
      feels to be more in-line with a LISP-1 whereas the special
      syntax feels more like a distinct LISP-2 namespace.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a crucial distinction between the above idea and other lisps,
      parentheses would be used to indicate evaluation only and
      therefore this is likely to subsequently diverge from true
      lispiness where everything also comes back to pairs/cons
      cells. The use of that construct is certainly feasible but the
      syntactic elements are intended to more clearly convey the
      semantics of the data independently of the implementation
      (i.e. dictionaries may best be represented as alists but the
      syntax doesn't care).
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach could help to address both challenges related to
      the the structure of logic and the data upon which it is acting,
      and also the struggle to represent a wide range of data types
      and semantics over portable formats such as
      <a href="https://yaml.org"

	 data-atime="2024-04-17">YAML</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For systems programming I'm currently gravitating towards
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)"
	 title="Rust (programming language) - Wikipedia"
	 data-atime="2024-04-17">Rust</a>.
      I first dabbled with Rust a few years ago and found the language
      generally very appealing, but the Rust compiler is also relatively
      large and so I instead wanted to bolster my low-level knowledge with
      tools I could understand more completely and feasibly bootstrap.
      The confluence of reading an article about
      <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/research/co-developing-programs-and-their-proof-of-correctness/"
	 title="Co-Developing Programs and Their Proof of Correctness – Communications of the ACM"
	 data-atime="2024-04-14">provable correctness with SPARK</a>,
      (which mentions Rust), a general fondness for the declarative
      nature of Rust's ownership model, the recognition that smaller compilers
      tend to also result in less helpful feedback, and Rust popping up for a project
      at work has pushed me into taking a deeper plunge regardless of the size.
      I may still have an interest in alternatives such as Zig, but Rust
      has popularity in its favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do have some concerns around some of the recent supposed missteps over
      <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/17/rust_foundation_apologizes_trademark_policy"
	 title="Rust Foundation apologizes for trademark policy confusion • The Register"
	 data-atime="2024-04-18">their intellectual property</a>
      but for the time being I'll optimistically trust those to work out (and be ready
      to pivot if they don't).
