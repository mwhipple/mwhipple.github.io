	In addition to convenience, shebangs provide a decoupling
	mechanism, as the means through which a command is executed
	can be hidden from call sites. Along with naming the resulting
	file appropriately generally (i.e. avoiding an extension that
	implies implementation), this allows for replacing the
	implementation over time (for example starting with a more
	rapidly usable but more limited alternative and subsequently
	replacing it with something else in the interest of
	performance or power.
