        My personal perspective in automotive technology is dominated
        by sustainability and minimalism, but I also have some professional
        interest and therefore will dig a bit more deeply.

        <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
        <p>
          Autonomous vehicles (AVs) (specifically land vehicles) are something for which
          I'm very hopeful since they could reduce or avoid the need for ownership
          and similarly could reduce the number of total vehicles needed to exist
          given that the capacity could be defined in terms of the amount of
          contemporaneous volume of travel rather than what translates to what
          is closer to a capacity that effectively represents everyone traveling
          simultaneously (where this feels like a generally recurring fallacy
          that likely has a name). This also lends itsely to further optimizations
          in terms of both reducing travel time (i.e. reducing traffic) and
          introducing queuing with corresponding incentives to reduce needed capacity
          by absorbing bursts (similar to existing peak/congestion pricing models
          where a given traveler pays extra or waits some amount of time).
          Unfortunately I'm also somewhat skeptical in the realization of such
          reductions in that it may challenge the business models of many involved
          players (i.e. manufacturers) and the persistent risk that such gains
          in efficiency are offset by rebound effects.

          At present there remains a fairly wide gap between the current state
          of artifical initelligence (AI) systems and their envisioned end state and
          their advertised abilities (which should be covered elsewhere) and AVs are a particularly
          clear example of this given the surrounding safety concerns.
          AVs may operate in environments with a virtually unlimited number of
          variables which can fall very easily into the cracks of modern AI.
          While operating in environments where such variables can be controlled is
          a wise and employed tactic, it is important in other cases to make sure
          that variations are not aggregated away when presenting statistics and that
          instead significant conditional probabilies are expressed. This can help
          paint an appropriately

          which may also feed more directly into questions around how the levels of
          autonomy within the system could safely integrate with propsective human
          invervention when necessary.
