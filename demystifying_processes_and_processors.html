From the other direction there also sometimes seems to be ideas
that processes can somehow request some amount of processing
power. This seems to have been potentially introduced through
the Kubernetes (and similar systems) concept of CPU requests and
weak understanding around the roles of pod scheduling and container
runtime and how the Linux scheduler works. Somehow although presumably
nobody with this idea has ever written code to request processing
there is a perception that such a concept has crept into the many
layers of magic upon which we currently place our code.

The above points should help adjust perspectives but does not
explicitly explain how any process could ever make use of more than
one processor. To retroactively define terms, most of this is page is
using "process" in the sense used by the Linux kernel which clearly
aligns with the initial description of it as effectively a struct of
memory addresses suitable for execution by a given processor - the
concept of "threads" are simply processes which share memory (and as a
result have lower creation/forking overhead). The ability to make use
of processing power exceeding a single core is a function of using
multiple such runnable processes or threads. Making use of
multi-threading is a large topic and can be a bit of an art, but
suffice it to say that you can't use more processors than you have
processes and efficiency requires more attention than spinning up a
bunch of threads and expecting to be able to turn some kind of dial.
