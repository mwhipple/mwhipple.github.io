<h2 id="org2299101"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> A Process is Acted Upon</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
A process is essentially dormant - it is an instance of executing a
stored program which amounts to a struct that points to the relevant
memory addresses. It is <span class="underline">not</span> something that has a life of its own.
On the lowest level the processor itself is what activates your
process as it performs the operations of the program and advances the
address of the instruction pointer. This distinction may seem nebulous
but even in the case where the process is directly loaded onto a
processor it can be useful in understanding how other pieces of the
puzzle fit together. For many years I silently wondered how processes
could do nothing - what were my programs doing when they were waiting
for something to happen but not spinlocking? The perspective that
process are actively in control leads to some anthropomorphic notions
but the shift to the more accurate perspective of the process being
consumed by the processor makes any pause of such consumption a clear
option.
</p>

<p>
This is more relevant in the context of a typical OS scheduler. In
this model which processes can be consumed when is at the discretion
of the scheduler (and which processes are on a scheduler rather than
something like a wait queue are at the discretion of the operating
system). While the kernel deals with the onslaught of system calls and
interrupts it remains in regular (albeit not constant) control of how
user-land is mapped to hardware. The scheduler therefore regularly
decides which processors will be consumed by which processes.
</p>

<p>
This perspective popped up most recently related to observing CPU
usage on Kubernetes where I was in a conversation with someone where
we were in agreement about everything that mattered but I inferred
that the other person was suggesting that processes would somehow need
to be prevented from accessing processors rather than simply not be
scheduled (i.e. they were active entities that needed to be put on a
leash rather than just a to-do list that could be not
read). Specifically we were both advocating avoidance of CPU limits
and letting the scheduler do its thing but he was suggesting that
throttling would still be a useful metric. Having spent a fair amount
of time a few months ago collecting information to assuage fears about
the removal of CPU limits (a campaign I've waged at multiple
organizations) and based on resulting behavior my assertion is that
throttling is not even reported when limits and cgroup quotas are not
in play. This is coincidentally a natural segue to the next topic.

<h2 id="org359cf00"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Processor Access is Binary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
A process is either on a processor or it is not, or perhaps in clearer
terms given some of the previously mentioned considerations - a
processor is only consuming a single process at any given time
and that is what the processor is doing at that time.
</p>

<p>
This leads to what is likely fairly common advice to
<b>not express CPU usage as a percentage</b>. Any time I've ever been in a
meeting where such a metric has been displayed it has either yielded
confusion or more innocuously the desire that the information is
presented more legibly. This mirrors standard practice to prefer
metrics such as system load.
</p>

<p>
Anytime anything is expressed as a percentage the first question is
"percentage of what?". From the perspective of a system percentage may
be reasonable as a proportion of cores for that system (though as
mentioned load is typically more useful) but for a process the
appropriate whole is far more nebulous. Such a percentage may be in
terms where each hundred corresponds to a single core such that the actual
whole is one hundred multiplied by the number of cores used or one
hundred may represent the capacity on the host machine or it may
represent something else. The signal within such metrics can be
non-obvious, particularly due to possible variations across a cluster.
</p>

<p>
Another underlying consideration which is a driver for preferring load
is that detection of CPU usage in proportion to capacity is not
inherently useful. Processors are used but they are not <span class="underline">used up</span> -
there are posts that refer to CPU as a "renewable resource" which may
be useful to help adjust perspective but it may be better to just
avoid thinking of it needing to be renewed. Similarly it may be best
to avoid terms such as "exhaustion" when discussing CPU since it
naturally leads to thinking of processors in similar terms to memory
or storage where the system can suffer if there pressure is introduced
by operating close to capacity. There <span class="underline">can</span> be concerns around given
work not acquiring enough CPU time but the view should be more of
passing work through persistent shared resources rather than the
resources themselves being modified (and generally tracking any such
concerns should be driven from the work done rather than the resources
used). In practical terms spare CPU cycles represent time during which
resources were not used and therefore from a cost efficiency
perspective it can be preferable to keep processors fully utilized and
therefore presenting the data in a format which may lead to thinking
of being at capacity is problematic should be avoided.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned repeatedly, using load is preferable from a system
perspective and from a process perspective it is far clearer to
convey usage in terms of time spent active (which is how it is
typically reported). At any given instant a process will be in one
state or another and therefore within any given window of time
(typically a second) a process will have spent a certain amount of
time in each state. This can then be presented against total time for
the underlying resources without inviting any of the above ambiguities
and hoping to deter confusion.

<h2 id="orgdb2b320"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Processor Use is Binary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
On a closely related note, a processor is either being used or it is
not. Another big reason to avoid the use of expressing CPU usage in
percentage is that there may be a perspective that a process is using
anything along the lines of "half of a processor" (rather than the
more accurate perspective of using a processor for half of the time)
and presented data should not reinforce any such ideas.
</p>

<p>
From the other direction there also sometimes seems to be ideas
that processes can somehow request some amount of processing
power. This seems to have been potentially introduced through
the Kubernetes (and similar systems) concept of CPU requests and
weak understanding around the roles of pod scheduling and container
runtime and how the Linux scheduler works. Somehow although presumably
nobody with this idea has ever written code to request processing
there is a perception that such a concept has crept into the many
layers of magic upon which we currently place our code.
</p>

<p>
The above points should help adjust perspectives but does not
explicitly explain how any process could ever make use of more than
one processor. To retroactively define terms, most of this is page is
using "process" in the sense used by the Linux kernel which clearly
aligns with the initial description of it as effectively a struct of
memory addresses suitable for execution by a given processor - the
concept of "threads" are simply processes which share memory (and as a
result have lower creation/forking overhead). The ability to make use
of processing power exceeding a single core is a function of using
multiple such runnable processes or threads. Making use of
multi-threading is a large topic and can be a bit of an art, but
suffice it to say that you can't use more processors than you have
processes and efficiency requires more attention than spinning up a
bunch of threads and expecting to be able to turn some kind of dial.
