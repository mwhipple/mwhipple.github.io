- [Up to Clothes](clothes)

Sewing (for repairs) is something that I've done sporadically over
the years but admittedly have probably never known how to actually
do it correctly; tending to stick some thread on a needle which is
then haphazardly worked through some fabric and then in some way
or another tied resulting in what amounts to some kind of messy
knot that passes through fabric.

I'm now going to work on actually learning how to do it reasonably
properly at least for the sake of sewing badges on uniforms and also
to make some repairs such as a bag that I have from which the should
strap keeps falling off (including after having it sewn back on at
the dry cleaner several years ago).

One of the underlying skills would be tying a knot, where the
instructions on the
[Sewing Directory](https://www.thesewingdirectory.co.uk/tying-a-knot/ "Tying a Knot in Thread - The Sewing Directory"){atime=2024-08-29}
seem able to be figured out and allowed me tie a fairly large
knot which allowed me to attempt to sew the bag in need of 
repair (after several smaller knots passed through the holes).

## Bag Repair

My wife got my a small murse-y type bag many years ago, which
appeals to my minimal sensibility since it can fit some of my
mobile gadgets while being a notably smaller form factor than
what would be required for a decent sized laptop along with
accompanying wires and peripherals. I think the bag itself was
fairly inexpensive and the shoulder strap came detached after a
few years. The bag otherwise is still in decent shape and so
at this point I'd be looking to reattach the strap by whatever
means works sufficiently. Getting resewn at a tailor didn't last long;
I tried krazy glue out of laziness which actually worked better
than expected (lasted a few months), and currently it's using a
mix of my attempting to sew it along with a fresh coating of
kragle. My attempt at sewing was sloppy (it's fairly awkward and
also needs to pass through some fairly thick fake leather and canvas)
but seems effective, though I think for my first attempt I used
too large of a needle (ones that came with a set of thimbles I
ordered and are probably all large enough to be for the type of
work invites thimbles). I'll probably iterate on this a bit,
but may also look at something like rivets if it continues to
come undone (before just giving up and tossing the bag).
