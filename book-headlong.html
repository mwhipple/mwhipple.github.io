      <h1>Headlong</h1>

      <p>
	I recently read
	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Headlong-Ron-MacLean/dp/1938692985"
	   title="Headlong"
	   data-atime="2024-05-21">Headlong</a> by Ron MacLean. I
	worked with Ron at the time it was published and grabbed a
	copy at a reading he did in Somerville at the time, but
	given my shabby history of reading for pleasure I only got
	around to reading it ten years later.
      </p>

	The delay was probably overall fortunate in that I'm now at
	the same stage of life as the protagonist. It's a good book;
	there are aspects that may be dated given how much has changed
	in the world since then and how much the book draws on
	the passed present (but I'm far too cloistered to be an
	accurate gauge of that), but the underlying themes and
	messages are timeless and the book delivered a compelling
	blend of entertainment sprinkled with emotional tugs.
      </p>
      <p>
	It was rather different from the presumptions I'd imposed upon
	it and deepens my perspective on a former colleague (with whom
	I haven't retained contact).
