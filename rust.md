[Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language) "Rust (programming language) - Wikipedia"){atime="2024-04-17"}
is likely the language that most appealing to me in terms of popular
systems languages.
The Rust compiler is also relatively large
and so I alsowanted to bolster my low-level knowledge with tools I
could understand more completely and feasibly bootstrap. The confluence
of reading an article about
[provable correctness with SPARK](https://cacm.acm.org/research/co-developing-programs-and-their-proof-of-correctness/ "Co-Developing Programs and Their Proof of Correctness – Communications of the ACM"){atime="2024-04-14"}
(which mentions Rust), a general fondness for the declarative nature of
Rust's ownership model, the recognition that smaller compilers tend to
also result in less helpful feedback, and Rust popping up for a project
at work has pushed me into taking a deeper plunge regardless of the
size. In addition to providing ergonomic use of core functionality,
Rust also offers a fair amount of

I may still have an interest in alternatives such as Zig, but Rust
has popularity in its favor.

I do have some concerns around some of the recent supposed missteps over

but for the time being I'll optimistically trust those to work out (and
be ready to pivot if they don't).
