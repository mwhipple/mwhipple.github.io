Several years ago my smart watch got broken while going through
the Polar Caves in New Hampshire, and I ended up replacing it
with a [PineTime](https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTime "PineTime - PINE64"){atime="2024-08-08"}
which appeals to my hacker sensibilities (and as a side effect
requires a fair amount of additional attention to get value.
