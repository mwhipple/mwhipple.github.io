    <h1>Video</h1>

    <p>
      Somewhat ironically I worked for several years at a company
      that's in the online video business (Brightcove), but didn't
      feel like I've really starting digging into the details
      of video until several years after leaving. My time there was
      instead spent on the data that surrounds and enables accessing
      the Video, and while I acquired a fair amount of familiarity
      with some of those proximal concerns, dealing with the binary
      content of the videos themselves were handled by other teams and
      not of particular interest to me (and I had more than enough to
      keep me busy).

      It is likely because I was at a company surrounded by people
      with relevant expertise that I was able to focus elsewhere, and
      am now left to venture down more of those alleys myself while
      tackling a video project. Hopefully the project itself will
      be able to produce some shareable artifacts.

      I'm currently experimenting a bite with (Low-Latency) LL-HLS. I
      was drawn to HLS due to my recollection of it being a
      wonderfully simple and widely supported approach (which is
      somewhat of a given for an Apple Web standard). LL-HLS is a more
      recent extension and so far it seems as though support outside
      of the official Apple tools remains fairly unpolished and so
      I'll be working through some of the plumbing as I go.

      WebRTC is likely the cool new kid on the block (was Donny the
      cool one?), and while there's a fair amount of considerations
      that I've weighed suffice it to say in the short term that
      peer-to-peer is not a clear match for the problem I'm exploring
      nor is there any identified need for ultra low-latency such as in
      support of interactivity.

      blog post provides a decent summary of the overall solution
      (in-depth is certainly a relative term). In particular this
      page provides a good background on the relationship between
      (I) key frames and independent/regular segments which leads in
      to wider considerations of being able to send less bits through
      batching which could not only yield throughput benefits but also
      offset transfer time.

      digs deeper into the different types of frames and how they compose
      into Groups of Pictures (GOPs).
