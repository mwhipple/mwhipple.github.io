    <h1>Video</h1>

    <p>
      Somewhat ironically I worked for several years at a company
      that's in the online video business (Brightcove), but didn't
      feel like I've really starting digging into the details
      of video until several years after leaving. My time there was
      instead spent on the data that surrounds and enables accessing
      the Video, and while I acquired a fair amount of familiarity
      with some of those proximal concerns, dealing with the binary
      content of the videos themselves were handled by other teams and
      not of particular interest to me (and I had more than enough to
      keep me busy).
    </p>
    <p>
      It is likely because I was at a company surrounded by people
      with relevant expertise that I was able to focus elsewhere, and
      am now left to venture down more of those alleys myself while
      tackling a video project. Hopefully the project itself will
      be able to produce some shareable artifacts.

      I'm currently experimenting a bite with (Low-Latency) LL-HLS. I
      was drawn to HLS due to my recollection of it being a
      wonderfully simple and widely supported approach (which is
      somewhat of a given for an Apple Web standard). LL-HLS is a more
      recent extension and so far it seems as though support outside
      of the official Apple tools remains fairly unpolished and so
      I'll be working through some of the plumbing as I go.

      WebRTC is likely the cool new kid on the block (was Donny the
      cool one?), and while there's a fair amount of considerations
      that I've weighed suffice it to say in the short term that
      peer-to-peer is not a clear match for the problem I'm exploring
      nor is there any identified need for ultra low-latency such as in
      support of interactivity.

      blog post provides a decent summary of the overall solution
      (in-depth is certainly a relative term). In particular this
      page provides a good background on the relationship between
      (I) key frames and independent/regular segments which leads in
      to wider considerations of being able to send less bits through
      batching which could not only yield throughput benefits but also
      offset transfer time.

      Apple provides nicely consumable documentation for
      <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming"
	 title="HTTP Live Streaming | Apple Developer Documentation"
	 data-atime="2024-04-24">HLS</a> and its range of variations.
      Some of the HLS support tools that it provides are behind the
      Apple Developer login for whatever (so I had to go through my
      periodic search for valid credentials).
    </p>
    <p>
      A key discovery while chasing down some of the LL-HLS details
      which is touched on very briefly in the Apple docs but often
      glossed over elsewhere is that it will typically rely on less
      widely supported HTTP features such as Chunked Transfer
      Encoding). LL-HLS in particular (compared to LL-DASH/CMAF-CTE or
      HESP) offers a solution that does not require this support
      through supporting distinct files for partial segments and their
      aggregation into complete segments, but this either requires
      additional server-side logic to handle that aggregation without
      redundant transfer or what amounts to transferring all
      of the content twice. None of these considerations are
      particularly hairy problems but represent a significant shift
      compared to how readily non-LL counterparts can be delivered
      using commodity protocols with typical configurations.
