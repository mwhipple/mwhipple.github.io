A process is essentially dormant - it is an instance of executing a
stored program which amounts to a struct that points to the relevant
memory addresses. It is _not_ something that has a life of its own.
On the lowest level the processor itself is what activates your
process as it performs the operations of the program and advances the
address of the instruction pointer. This distinction may seem nebulous
but even in the case where the process is directly loaded onto a
processor it can be useful in understanding how other pieces of the
puzzle fit together. For many years I silently wondered how processes
could do nothing - what were my programs doing when they were waiting
for something to happen but not spinlocking? The perspective that
process are actively in control leads to some anthropomorphizing
