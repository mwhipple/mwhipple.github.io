I've recently started to pay closer attention to food sourcing and
preparation. Likely the most significant impacts are from pursuing
plastic neutrality, which at least in my location is very limiting in
that plastic packaging for food seems widespread. I also prefer local
foods though for most cases this seems far more straightforward than
plastic avoidance. This page is currently just a dumping ground of
information and lists that will be cleaned up as I go.

### Taco Seasoning

The recipe on the
[McCormick site](https://www.mccormick.com/recipes/other/homemade-taco-seasoning "Recipe for Taco Seasoning: How to Make Taco Seasoning | McCormick"){atime="2024-05-30"}
was the first one I stumbled across when trying to throw some seasoning
together. That is was paprika-heavy seemed like a safe bet given that my
children are not yet ready for too much spice and it was well received
so this is my current go-to recipe. I tend to go light on the salt and
otherwise measure everything by weight with the translation of grams
that are equal to two times the listed teaspoons (i.e. 1.5tsp -\> 3g),
which is almost certainly not quite the same ratios but it satisfies the
main goal of taco night which is to appease my kids.
