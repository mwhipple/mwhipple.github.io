      I'm (optimistically) starting to dabble in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodworking"
	 title="Woodworking - Wikipedia"
	 data-atime="2024-04-01">woodwoorking</a>. My family has a decent history
      in woodworking including my father from whom I inherited a fair amount of tools,
      but my goals for the foreseeable future remain fairly modest and utilitarian.      
    </p>

    <p>
      My first planned project is to build some replacement handles for a Weber
      kettle grill where currently I have to use grill gloves at all times.
      This seems like a good starting project to mostly just work on my setup,
      as the amount there are minimal requirements aside from attaching wood to
      act as an insulator in a form that will fit reasonably well and not leave
      anyything exposed that could lead to burns. Over time I'd also want to make
      sure the handles can decently withstand weather, but for the first iteration I
      can just plan on replacing them if that becomes an issue.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'll also plan on alternating a bit between somewhat canned projects and those
      that are more self-directed, allowing each such canned project to hopefully
      refine some skills and my workshop setup prior to each project.

      To start I purchased and read
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y3KD283?ref=yb_qv_ov_kndl_dp_rw"
	 title="Amazon.com: Beginner's Guide to Starting Woodworking eBook : Turner, Ben: Books"
	 data-atime="2024-04-01">Beginner's Guide to Starting Woodworking by Lawrence Turner</a>.
      It was nice in that it was short...and that's about it. The pictures on the ebook
      didn't display but more significantly there was virtually no
      insight in the book so it seemed less of an introduction to
      the craft and more of an invitation for experimentation to
      those who have never made anything from wood before. The content seemed worth a blog post
      but did not quite seem worth even the $0.99 USD that was paid.
