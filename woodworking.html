      I'm (optimistically) starting to dabble in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodworking"
	 title="Woodworking - Wikipedia"
	 data-atime="2024-04-01">woodwoorking</a>. My family has a decent history
      in woodworking including my father from whom I inherited a fair amount of tools,
      but my goals for the foreseeable future remain fairly modest and utilitarian.
