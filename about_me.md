- [Up to Home](./)

By profession I\'m a software engineer/architect and typically spend my
days shepherding large scale
[distributed cloud systems](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2482856 "There’s Just No Getting around It: You’re Building a Distributed System - ACM Queue"){atime="2024-02-14"}.
Outside of that I'm somewhat of a minimalist who pursues
[sustainability](sustainability), a husband, father, musician,
[empiricist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism "Empricism - Wikipedia"){date="2024-02-02"},
and someone who needs to devote time to a wider range of hobbies.
