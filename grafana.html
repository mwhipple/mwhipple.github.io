      <p>Grafana is a tool I first started using profesionally about a decade ago but
      have since spent most of my time using paid SaaS alternatives. Almost certainly
      the single biggest challenge with a stack involving Grafana is that a decent
      experience may require a fair amount of knowledge and attention for optimized
      data acess. Grafana itself has some UX quirks, tends to be a bit too tied to
      implementations for my taste, and has not historically lent itself to declarative configuration
      which could be more conducive for infrastructure-as-code or abstraction.
      There are efforts to provide more revoluationary changes which I'll likely start tracking.</p>

      <p>Grafana seems to remain the dominant open-source metric visualization tool, however,
      and given that I periodically need to work with it I'll be starting to dig into it and
      also look to introduce some of its stack for some of my personal toy projects.</p>
