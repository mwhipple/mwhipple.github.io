Certainly one of the biggest topics in modern software is
generative artificial intelligence. So far I haven't directly
used it but have read a fair amount about it.

## AI Copilots as Enablers for Practical Skills

Recently I've been involved in the first screening
panel from engineering candidates since AI copilots have become
a practical concern. As a combination of those conversations,
wider engineering cultural conversations, and reading
[one of the stream of articles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10589683 "Professors Rethink How They Teach Coding"){atime="2024-08-04"}
about the imact on education has made me realized that in
probably most contexts such copilots are an enabler for
more practical skills as a practictioner.

It's a fairly widespread (though not inarguable) stance that
knowledge and attention to syntactical details may provide
little value of an engineer over a compiler, but a further
extension is that the majority of the code that an engineer will
typically work with is not that which they have written and
instead will be a combination of inherited ("legacy") code,
code from teammates, or third-party code. This in turn leads
to perspectives such as the ablility to read and maintain code
outweighing that of producing fresh code (at least in terms of
time if nothing else). In terms of day-to-day work this manifests
not only in discovery related to work being done directly, but
also efforts such as reviewing pull requests which can act as
a vital channel for distributing knowledge across a team
(in addition to the more obvious goals of butt-covering
and potential compliance).

All of this suggests that the use of Generative AI in coding
can transcend "this can produce my code faster" to 
"this can enable development of the more rounded set of skills
that are crucial to a software engineering organization."

As a disclaimer, I personally do not yet use copilots and my
untested opinion is that they are a largely outsized solution
that are a side effect of somewhat stagnant perspectives
on coding that could be addressed by more deterministic
tactics...but that's unhelpfully idealistic given the
current state and in either case the result is that
less time should be spent writing code but there remain
plenty of other things to worry about.
