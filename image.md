Image is definitely not a priority for me particularly since I work from home,
but I do have to make myself presentable periodically.

## Shaving

I generally have a beard from fall through winter and am clean'ish shaven
from spring through summer to mix things up. While I haven't shaven more
than weekly for quite a while, I've tended to slip into less than that;
letting the stubble to get long enough that the razor struggles a bit.

A little while ago I picked up a
[Leaf razor](https://leafshave.com/ "Leaf Shave Official | Plastic Free Shaving Made Easy"){atime="2024-08-19"}.
I ordered it from Grove and unfortunately the description is a bit light
and therefore I (like seemingly others based on the reviews) got the pivoting
razor that is _not_ designed for face shaving. So far I've worked through it,
though some areas such as under my nose are particularly tricky to shave, but
I'll probably pick up one of the face razors at some point (and maybe offer this
one to my wife). It's worked well other than that though I'm also not particular
at the moment in this regard (it removes hair).
I had one unfortunate incident where one of the blades was not fully
seated and thefore slipped onto a diagaonal and gave me a nice slice across my cheek
(so that's certainly something with which to be careful).
