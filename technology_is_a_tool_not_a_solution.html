      </header>

      <p>The general sentiment that progress is a intrinsic to technology is
      evinced on a broader scale in the form of
      <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/technology-imperative"
         title="technology imperative"
         data-atime="2024-07-01">technology imperative</a> lines of thought,
      but also play out routinely on a smaller scale within the confines of
      software engineering.</p>

      <p>In what is perhaps the most benign form this manifests
      as adopting outsized technologies to scratch particular itches at the cost
      of sometimes massive increases in complexity or footprint. This often
      takes the form of the inability to articulate (and likely understand)
      precise problems while suggesting that a particular technology will resolve
      issues. Some anecdotal stories for this case that spring to mind involve
      multiple companies around 2020 where developers eagerly promoted GraphQL
      as a solution to perceived API deficiencies which in one case led to
      wallpapering over the underlying issues leading to slower response times
      and higher operational expenditures and in another just led to talking
      someone down to the fact that what they were really after was caching
      (GraphQL can be great but it needs to rest atop a well defined model
      rather than attempting to compensate for a poorly defined one).</p>
 
      <p>In more insidious cases this can amount to attempting to apply
      what are largely mechanical solutions to underlying cultural issues.
      There exist relatively sticky issues that require dedicated attention
      but often technological silver bullets are pursued instead. This is likely
      to lead to the technical equivalent of a cycle of reorganizations where
      changes are thrown at the wall in the hopes that something will stick.</p>

      <p>This is not the ravings of a Luddite: technology can be a very valuable tool
      but the desired first-class values must be defined and tracked rather than
      being seduced into thinking there is inherent benefit in the technology itself
      or that what value is realized will offset the costs of adoption (not tracking
      the latter is quick path to a lot of churn).</p>
