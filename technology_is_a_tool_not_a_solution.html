<p>The general sentiment that progress is a intrinsic to technology is
evinced on a broader scale in the form of <a
href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/technology-imperative"
data-atime="2024-07-01" title="technology imperative">technology
imperative</a> lines of thought and more general issues that arise due
to <a

data-atime="&quot;2024-07-03"
title="The Ethical Dilemma at the Heart of Big Tech Companies">misaligned
incentives</a>, but also play out routinely on a smaller scale within
the confines of software engineering.</p>
<p>In what is perhaps the most benign form this manifests as adopting
outsized technologies to scratch particular itches at the cost of
sometimes massive increases in complexity or footprint. This often takes
the form of the inability to articulate (and likely understand) precise
problems while suggesting that a particular technology will resolve
issues. Some anecdotal stories for this case that spring to mind involve
multiple companies around 2020 where developers eagerly promoted GraphQL
as a solution to perceived API deficiencies which in one case led to
wallpapering over the underlying issues leading to slower response times
and higher operational expenditures and in another just led to talking
someone down to the fact that what they were really after was caching
(GraphQL can be great but it needs to rest atop a well defined model
rather than attempting to compensate for a poorly defined one).</p>
<p>In more insidious cases this can amount to attempting to apply what
are largely mechanical solutions to underlying cultural issues. There
exist relatively sticky issues that require dedicated attention but
often technological silver bullets are pursued instead. This is likely
to lead to the technical equivalent of a cycle of reorganizations where
changes are thrown at the wall in the hopes that something will
stick.</p>
<p>This is not the ravings of a Luddite: technology can be a very
valuable tool but the desired first-class values must be defined and
tracked rather than being seduced into <a
href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/the-techno-pro-attitude/"
data-atime="2024-07-02"
title="The Techno-Pro Attitude – Communications of the ACM">thinking
there is inherent benefit in technology itself</a> or that what value is
realized will offset the costs of adoption (not tracking the latter is
quick path to a lot of churn). Without such tracking technology is
reduced to an incarnation of a solution looking for a problem.</p>
