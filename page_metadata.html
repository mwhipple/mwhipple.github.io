      <p>Page Metadata is supporting information about the page contents.
      "Meta" is an overused
      prefix and "metadata" in particular tends to seemingly get abused - within the
      context of content authoring and for this page "metadata" reflects information
      which is defined outside of the main content container (and typically subjected
      to more specialized processing). This becomes largely a technical rather than a
      semantic distinction as the "metadata" may provide what amounts to structured
      content and conversely the content area may include elements such as navigation
      which fall outside the primary content.</p>
